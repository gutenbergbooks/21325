<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="minor" />

<p>I was stimulated to write these Outlines of
Greek and Roman Medicine by a recent sojourn
in the south-eastern part of Europe. The name
of the book defines, to some extent, its limitations,
for my desire has been to give merely a general
outline of the most important stages in the
advancement of the healing art in the two Empires
to which modern civilization is most deeply
indebted. There are a few great works on the
history of medicine by continental writers, such,
for instance, as those by the German writers,
Baas, Sprengel, and Puschmann, but, generally
speaking, the subject has been much neglected.</p>

<p>I cherish the hope that this little work may
appeal to doctors, to medical students, and to
those of the public who are interested in a
narration of the progress of knowledge, and who
realize that the investigation of the body in
health and disease has been one of the most
important features of human endeavour.</p>

<p>The medical profession deserves censure for
neglect of its own history, and pity 'tis that so
many practitioners know nothing of the story of
their art. For this reason many reputed discoveries
are only re-discoveries; as Bacon wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
"Medicine is a science which hath been, as
we have said, more professed than laboured, and
yet more laboured than advanced; the labour
having been, in my judgment, rather in circle than
in progression. For I find much iteration, and
small progression." Of late years, however, the
History of Medicine has been coming into its
kingdom. Universities are establishing courses of
lectures on the subject, and the Royal Society
of Medicine recently instituted a historical section.</p>

<p>The material I have used in this book has been
gathered from many sources, and, as far as possible,
references have been given, but I have sought for,
and taken, information wherever it could best be
found. As Montaigne wrote: "I have here only
made a nosegay of culled flowers, and have
brought nothing of my own but the thread that
ties them together."</p>

<p>I have to express my indebtedness to my friend,
Mr. J. Scott Riddell, M.V.O., M.A., M.B., C.M.,
Senior Surgeon, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, for his
great kindness in reading the proof-sheets, preparing
the index and seeing this book through the
press and so removing one of the difficulties which
an author writing overseas has to encounter; also
to my publishers for their courtesy and attention.</p>

<h3>EARLY ROMAN MEDICINE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Origin of Healing &mdash; Temples &mdash; Lectisternium &mdash; Temple of
&AElig;sculapius &mdash; Archagathus &mdash; Domestic Medicine &mdash; Greek
Doctors &mdash; Cloaca Maxima &mdash; Aqueducts &mdash; State of the early
Empire.</p></div>

<p>The origin of the healing art in Ancient Rome
is shrouded in uncertainty. The earliest practice
of medicine was undoubtedly theurgic, and common
to all primitive peoples. The offices of priest and
of medicine-man were combined in one person,
and magic was invoked to take the place of knowledge.
There is much scope for the exercise of the
imagination in attempting to follow the course of
early man in his efforts to bring plants into
medicinal use. That some of the indigenous
plants had therapeutic properties was often an
accidental discovery, leading in the next place to
experiment and observation. Cornelius Agrippa,
in his book on occult philosophy, states that mankind
has learned the use of many remedies from
animals. It has even been suggested that the
use of the enema was discovered by observing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
long-beaked bird drawing up water into its beak,
and injecting the water into the bowel. The
practice of healing, crude and imperfect, progressed
slowly in ancient times and was conducted
in much the same way in Rome, and among the
Egyptians, the Jews, the Chaldeans, Hindus and
Parsees, and the Chinese and Tartars.</p>

<p>The Etruscans had considerable proficiency in
philosophy and medicine, and to this people, as
well as to the Sabines, the Ancient Romans were
indebted for knowledge. Numa Pompilius, of
Sabine origin, who was King of Rome 715 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>,
studied physical science, and, as Livy relates, was
struck by lightning and killed as the result of his
experiments, and it has therefore been inferred
that these experiments related to the investigation
of electricity. It is surprising to find in the
Twelve Tables of Numa references to dental
operations. In early times, it is certain that the
Romans were more prone to learn the superstitions
of other peoples than to acquire much useful
knowledge. They were cosmopolitan in medical
art as in religion. They had acquaintance with
the domestic medicine known to all savages,
a little rude surgery, and prescriptions from the
Sibylline books, and had much recourse to magic.
It was to Greece that the Romans first owed their
knowledge of healing, and of art and science
generally, but at no time did the Romans equal
the Greeks in mental culture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Pliny states that "the Roman people for more
than six hundred years were not, indeed, without
medicine, but they were without physicians."
They used traditional family recipes, and had
numerous gods and goddesses of disease and
healing. Febris was the god of fever, Mephitis
the god of stench; Fessonia aided the weary, and
"Sweet Cloacina" presided over the drains.
The plague-stricken appealed to the goddess
Angeronia, women to Fluonia and Uterina.
Ossipaga took care of the bones of children, and
Carna was the deity presiding over the abdominal
organs.</p>

<p>Temples were erected in Rome in 467 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> in
honour of Apollo, the reputed father of &AElig;sculapius,
and in 460 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> in honour of &AElig;sculapius of
Epidaurus. Ten years later a pestilence raged
in the city, and a temple was built in honour of
the Goddess Salus. By order of the Sibylline
books, in 399 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, the first <i>lectisternium</i> was held
in Rome to combat a pestilence. This was a
festival of Greek origin. It was a time of prayer
and sacrifice; the images of the gods were laid
upon a couch, and a meal was spread on a table
before them. These festivals were repeated as
occasion demanded, and the device of driving a
nail into the temple of Jupiter to ward off "the
pestilence that walketh in darkness," and "destruction
that wasteth at noonday" was begun 360 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>
As evidence of the want of proper surgical knowledge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the fact is recorded by Livy that after the
Battle of Sutrium (309 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>) more soldiers died of
wounds than were killed in action. The worship
of &AElig;sculapius was begun by the Romans 291 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>,
and the Egyptian Isis and Serapis were also
invoked for their healing powers.</p>

<p>At the time of the great plague in Rome
(291 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>), ambassadors were sent to Epidaurus, in
accordance with the advice of the Sibylline books,
to seek aid from &AElig;sculapius. They returned with
a statue of the god, but as their boat passed up the
Tiber a serpent which had lain concealed during
the voyage glided from the boat, and landing on
the bank was welcomed by the people in the
belief that the god himself had come to their aid.
The Temple of &AElig;sculapius, which was built after
this plague in 291 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, was situated on the island
of the Tiber. Tradition states that, when the
Tarquins were expelled, their crops were thrown
into the river, and soil accumulated thereon until
ultimately the island was formed. In consequence
of the strange happening of the serpent landing
from the ship the end of the island on which the
Temple of &AElig;sculapius stood was shaped into the
form of the bow of a ship, and the serpent of
&AElig;sculapius was sculptured upon it in relief.</p>

<p>The island is not far from the &AElig;milian Bridge,
of which one broken arch remains.</p>

<p>Ovid represents this divinity as speaking
thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I come to leave my shrine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This serpent view, that with ambitious play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My staff encircles, mark him every way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His form&mdash;though larger, nobler, I'll assume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, changed as gods should be, bring aid to Rome."<br /></span>
</div><p class="citation">(Ovid, "Metamorphoses," xv.)</p></div>

<p>He is said to have resumed his natural form on
the island of the Tiber.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And now no more the drooping city mourns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy is again restored and health returns."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was the custom for patients to sleep under the
portico of the Temple of &AElig;sculapius, hoping that
the god of the healing art might inspire them in
dreams as to the system of cure they should adopt
for their illnesses. Sick slaves were left there by
their masters, but the number increased to such an
extent that the Emperor Claudius put a stop to the
cruel practice. The Church of St. Bartholomew
now stands on the ruins of the Temple of
&AElig;sculapius.</p>

<p>Even in very early times, however, Rome was
not without medical practitioners, though not so
well supplied as some other nations. The Lex
&AElig;milia, passed 433 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, ordained punishment for
the doctor who neglected a sick slave. In Plutarch's
"Life of Cato" (the Censor, who was born in 234 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>),
we read of a Roman ambassador who was sent
to the King of Bithynia, in Asia Minor, and who
had his skull trepanned.</p>

<p>The first regular doctor in Rome was Archagathus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
who began practice in the city 219 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, when the
authorities received him favourably and bought
a surgery for him; but his methods were rather
violent, and he made much use of the knife and
caustics, earning for himself the title of "butcher,"
and thus having fallen into disfavour, he was glad
to depart from Rome. A College of &AElig;sculapius
and of Health was established 154 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, but this
was not a teaching college in the present meaning
of the term.</p>

<p>The doctors of Ancient Rome took no regular
course of study, nor were any standards specified,
but as a rule knowledge was acquired by pupilage
to a practising physician, for which a honorarium
was paid. Subsequently the Archiatri, after the
manner of trade guilds, received apprentices, but
Pliny had cause to complain of the system of
medical education, or rather, to deplore the want
of it. He wrote: "People believed in anyone who
gave himself out for a doctor, even if the falsehood
directly entailed the greatest danger. Unfortunately,
there is no law which punishes doctors
for ignorance, and no one takes revenge on a doctor
if through his fault someone dies. It is permitted
him by our danger to learn for the future, at our death
to make experiments, and, without having to fear
punishment, to set at naught the life of a human
being."</p>

<p>Before the time when Greek doctors settled
in Rome, medical treatment was mainly under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the direct charge of the head of each household.
The father of a family had great powers conferred
upon him by the Roman law, and was physician as
well as judge over his family. If he took his new-born
infant in his arms he recognized him as his
son, but otherwise the child had no claim upon
him. He could inflict the most dire punishments
on members of his household for which they had no
redress.</p>

<p>Cato, the Elder, who died in <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> 149, wrote
a guide to domestic medicine for the use of Roman
fathers of the Republic, but he was a quack and
full of self-conceit. He hated the physicians
practising in Rome, who were mostly Greeks, and
thought that their knowledge was much inferior to
his own. Plutarch relates that Cato knew of the
answer given to the King of Persia by Hippocrates,
when sent for professionally, "I will never make
use of my art in favour of barbarians who are
enemies of the Greeks," and pretended to believe
that all Greek physicians were bound by the same
rule, and animated by the same motives. However,
Cato did a great deal of good by attempting to
lessen the vice and luxury of his age.</p>

<p>The Greeks in Rome were looked at askance
as foreign adventurers, and there is no doubt that
although many were honourable men, others came
to Rome merely to make money out of the superstitious
beliefs and credulity of the Roman people.
Fine clothes, a good house, and the giving of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
entertainments, were the best introduction to
practice that some of these practitioners could
devise.</p>

<p>The medical opinions of Cato throw a sidelight
upon the state of medicine in his time. He
attempted to cure dislocations by uttering a
nonsensical incantation: "<i>Huat hanat ista pista
sista damiato damnaustra!</i>" He considered ducks,
geese and hares a light and suitable diet for the
sick, and had no faith in fasting.</p>

<p>Although the darkness was prolonged and intense
before the dawn of medical science in Rome, yet,
in ancient times, there was a considerable amount
of knowledge of sanitation. The great sewer of
Rome, the <i>Cloaca Maxima</i>, which drained the
swampy valley between the Capitoline and Palatine
Hills, was built by order of Tarquinius Priscus
in 616 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> It is wonderful that at the present
time the visitor may see this ancient work in the
Roman Forum, and trace its course to the Tiber.
In the Forum, too, to the left of the Temple of
Castor, is the sacred district of Juturna, the nymph
of the healing springs which well up at the base of
the Palatine Hill. <i>Lacus Juturn&aelig;</i> is a four-sided
basin with a pillar in the middle, on which rested a
marble altar decorated with figures in relief. Beside
the basin are rooms for religious purposes. These
rooms are adorned with the gods of healing,
&AElig;sculapius with an acolyte holding a cock, the
Dioscuri and their horses, the head of Serapis, and
a headless statue of Apollo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The Cloaca Maxima was formed of three tiers
of arches, the vault within the innermost tier
being 14 ft. in diameter. The administration of
the sewers, in the time of the Republic, was in the
hands of the censors, but special officers called
<i>curatores cloacarum</i> were employed during the
Empire, and the workmen who repaired and
cleansed the sewers were condemned criminals.
These ancient sewers, which have existed for
twenty-five centuries, are monuments to the
wisdom and power of the people who built them.
In the time of Furius Camillus private drains
were connected with the public sewers which
were flushed by aqueduct and rain water. This
system has prevailed throughout the centuries.</p>

<p>The Aqueducts were also marvellous works, and
although they were added to in the time of the
Empire, Sextus Julius Frontinus, curator of waters
in the year <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 94, gives descriptions of the nine
ancient aqueducts, some of which were constructed
long before the Empire. For instance,
the <i>Aqua Appia</i> was conducted into the city three
hundred and twelve years before the advent of
Christ, and was about seven miles long. The
<i>Aqua Anio Vetus</i>, sixty-two miles in length, built
in <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> 144, was conveyed across the Campagna
from a source in the country beyond Tivoli. Near
this place there is a spring of milky-looking water
containing sulphurous acid, sulphurated lime, and
bicarbonate of lime, used now, and in ancient times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
for the relief of skin complaints. This water, at the
present day, has an almost constant temperature
of 75&deg;.</p>

<p>In course of time, when the Roman power was
being extended abroad, the pursuit of conquest
left little scope for the cultivation of the peaceful
arts and the investigation of science, and life itself
was accounted so cheap that little thought was
given to improving methods for the treatment of
the sick and wounded. On a campaign every
soldier carried on his person a field-dressing, and
the wounded received rough-and-ready first-aid
attention from their comrades in arms.</p>

<p>Later, when conquest was ended, and attention
was given to the consolidation of the provinces,
ease and happiness, as has been shown by Gibbon,
tended to the decay of courage and thus to lessen
the prowess of the Roman legions, but there was
compensation for this state of affairs at the heart
of the Empire because strong streams of capable
and robust recruits flowed in from Spain, Gaul,
Britain and Illyricum.</p>

<p>At its commencement, the Empire was in a
peaceful, and, on the whole, prosperous condition,
and the provincials, as well as the Romans,
"acknowledged that the true principles of social
life, laws, agriculture, and science, which had been
first invented by the wisdom of Athens, were now
firmly established by the power of Rome, under
whose auspicious influence the fiercest barbarians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
were united by an equal government and common
language. They affirm that with the improvement
of arts the human species was visibly multiplied.
They celebrate the increasing splendour of the
cities, the beautiful face of the country, cultivated
and adorned like an immense garden; and the long
festival of peace, which was enjoyed by so many
nations, forgetful of their ancient animosities, and
delivered from the apprehension of future danger."
Thus wrote the Roman historian, and Gibbon
states that when we discount as much of this as
we please as rhetorical and declamatory, the fact
remains that the substance of this description is
in accordance with the facts of history. Never
until the Christian era was any thought given
to the regular care of the helpless and the abject.
Slaves were often treated like cattle, and the
patricians had no bond of sympathy with the
plebeians. Provisions were sometimes distributed
to the poor, and taxes remitted, but for reasons
of State and not from truly charitable motives.
Authority was also given to parents to destroy
new-born infants whom they could not support.
The idea of establishing public institutions for
the relief of the sick and the poor did not enter
the minds of the ancient Romans.</p>

<p>Before considering the state of the healing art
throughout the period of the Roman Empire, it
is necessary to devote the next chapters to a
consideration of the rise and progress of medical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
science in Greece, for it cannot be too strongly
emphasized that Roman philosophy and Roman
medicine were borrowed from the Greeks, and it
is certain also that the Greeks were indebted to
the Egyptians for part of their medical knowledge.
The Romans were distinguished for their genius
for law-giving and government, the Greeks for
philosophy, art, and mental culture generally.</p>

<h3>EARLY GREEK MEDICINE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Apollo &mdash; &AElig;sculapius &mdash; Temples &mdash; Serpents &mdash; Gods of Health &mdash; Melampus &mdash; Homer &mdash; Machaon &mdash; Podalarius &mdash; Temples

of Renouard &mdash; Pythagoras &mdash; Democedes &mdash; Greek
Philosophers.</p></div>

<p>The history of healing begins in the Hellenic
mythology with Apollo, the god of light and the
promoter of health. In the "Iliad" he is hailed as
the disperser of epidemics, and, in this respect, the
ancients were well informed in attributing destruction
of infection to the sun's rays. Chiron, the
Centaur, it was believed, was taught by Apollo
and Artemis, and was the teacher, in turn, of
&AElig;sculapius, who probably lived in the thirteenth
century before Christ and was ultimately deified as
the Greek god of medicine. Pindar relates of
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"On some the force of charm&egrave;d strains he tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To some the medicated draught applied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some limbs he placed the amulets around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some from the trunk he cut, and made the patient sound."<a name="FNanchor_II_1" id="FNanchor_II_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_II_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&AElig;sculapius was too successful in his art, for his
death was attributed to Zeus, who killed him by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
flash of lightning, or to Pluto, both of whom were
thought to have feared that &AElig;sculapius might by
his skill gain the mastery over death.</p>

<p>Amid much that is mythological in the history
of &AElig;sculapius, there is a groundwork of facts.
Splendid temples were built to him in lovely and
healthy places, usually on a hill or near a spring;
they were visited by the sick, and the priests of
the temples not only attended to the worship of
&AElig;sculapius, but took pains to acquire knowledge
of the healing art. The chief temple was at
Epidaurus, and here the patients were well
provided with amusements, for close to the
temple was a theatre capable of seating 12,000
people, and a stadium built to accommodate 20,000
spectators.</p>

<p>A serpent entwined round a knotted staff is the
symbol of &AElig;sculapius. A humorist of the present
day has suggested that the knots on the staff
indicate the numerous "knotty" questions which
a doctor is asked to solve! Tradition states that
when &AElig;sculapius was in the house of his patient,
Glaucus, and deep in thought, a serpent coiled
itself around his staff. &AElig;sculapius killed it, and
then another serpent appeared with a herb leaf
in its mouth, and restored the dead reptile to life.
It seems probable that disease was looked upon
as a poison. Serpents produced poison, and had a
reputation in the most ancient times for wisdom,
and for the power of renovation, and it was thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
that a creature which could produce poison and
disease might probably be capable of curing as well
as killing. Serpents were kept in the Temples of
&AElig;sculapius, and were non-poisonous and harmless.
They were given their liberty in the precincts
of the temple, but were provided with a serpent-house
or den near to the altar. They were worshipped
as the incarnation of the god, and were
fed by the sick at the altar with "popana," or
sacrificial cakes.</p>

The Greek Deity of Health.<br />
<span style="font-size:75%;">From Wellcome&#39;s Medical Diary (Copyright)<br />

</p></div>

<p>Many of the Greek gods and goddesses were held
to have power over disease. Hygeia, known as
Salus to the Romans, was said to have been the
daughter of &AElig;sculapius, and to have taken care of
the sacred serpents (Plate II).</p>

<p>Melampus was considered by the Greeks the
first mortal to practise healing. In one case he
prescribed rust, probably the earliest use of iron
as a drug, and he also used hellebore root as a
purgative. He married a princess and was given
part of a kingdom as a reward for his services.
After his death he was awarded divine honours, and
temples were erected for his worship. The deification
of &AElig;sculapius and of Melampus added much
to the prestige of doctors in Greece, where they
were always held in honour; but in Rome the
practice of medicine was not considered a highly
honourable calling.</p>

<p>Something can be learned from the writings of
Homer of the state of medicine in his time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
although we need hardly expect to find in an epic
poem many references to diseases and their cure.
As dissection was considered a profanation of
the body, anatomical knowledge was exceedingly
meagre. Machaon was surgeon to Menelaus
and Podalarius was the pioneer of phlebotomy.
Both were regarded as the sons of &AElig;sculapius;
they were soldiers as well as doctors, and
fought before the walls of Troy. The surgery
required by Homer's heroes was chiefly that of the
battlefield. Unguents and astringents were in
use in the physician's art, and there is reference to
"nepenthe," a narcotic drug, and also to the use of
sulphur as a disinfectant. Doctors, according to
Homer, were held in high esteem, and Arctinus
relates that two divisions were recognized, surgeons
and physicians, the former held in less honour than
the latter&mdash;"Then Asclepius (&AElig;sculapius) bestowed
the power of healing upon his two sons; nevertheless,
he made one of the two more celebrated than
the other; on one did he bestow the lighter hand
that he might draw missiles from the flesh, and
sew up and heal all wounds; but the other he
endowed with great precision of mind, so as to
understand what cannot be seen, and to heal
seemingly incurable diseases."<a name="FNanchor_II_2" id="FNanchor_II_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_II_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Machaon fought in the army of Nestor. Fearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
for his safety, King Idomeneus placed him under
the charge of Nestor, who was instructed to take
the doctor into his chariot, for "a doctor is worth
many men." When Menelaus was wounded, a
messenger was sent for Machaon, who extracted the
barbed arrow, sucked the wound and applied a
secret ointment made known to &AElig;sculapius by
Chiron the Centaur, according to tradition.</p>

<p>The practice of Greek medicine became almost
entirely restricted to the temples of &AElig;sculapius,
the most important of which were situated at
Rhodes, Cnidus and Cos. The priests were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
known as Asclepiad&aelig;, but the name was
applied in time to the healers of the temple
who were not priests. Tablets were affixed to the
walls of these temples recording the name of the
patient, the disease and the cure prescribed. There
is evidence that diseases were closely observed.
The patients brought gifts to the temples, and
underwent a preliminary purification by ablutions,
fasting, prayer and sacrifice. A cock was a
common sacrifice to the god. No doubt many
wonderful cures were effected. Mental suggestion
was used greatly, and the patient was put
to sleep, his cure being often revealed to him
in a dream which was interpreted by the priests.
The expectancy of his mind, and the reduced state
of his body as the result of abstinence conduced to
a cure, and trickery also played a minor part.
Albeit, much of the treatment prescribed was
commendable. Pure air, cheerful surroundings,
proper diet and temperate habits were advocated,
and, among other methods of treatment, exercise,
massage, sea-bathing, the use of mineral waters,
purgatives and emetics, and hemlock as a sedative,
were in use. If a cure was not effected, the faith
of the patient was impugned, and not the power
of the god or the skill of the Asclepiades, so that
neither religion nor the practice of physic was
exposed to discredit. Great was the wisdom of
the Greeks! These temples were the famous
medical schools of ancient Greece. A spirit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
emulation prevailed, and a high ethical standard
was attained, as is shown by the oath prescribed
for students when they completed their course
of study. The form of oath will be found in a
succeeding chapter in connection with an account
of the life of Hippocrates.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="CATON" id="CATON"></a>
<img src="images/illus-041.png" width="725" height="600" alt="Health Temple"
title="HEALTH TEMPLE&mdash;RESTORED (Caton)." />
<p class="caption">HEALTH TEMPLE&mdash;RESTORED (Caton).</p></div>

<p>The remains of the Health Temple, or Asklepieion,
of Cos were brought to light in 1904 and
1905, by the work of Dr. Rudolf Herzog, of
T&uuml;bingen. Dr. Richard Caton, of Liverpool, has
been able to reconstruct pictorially the beautiful
buildings that existed two thousand years ago.
They were situated among the hills. The sacred
groves of cypresses were on three sides of the
temple, and "to the north the verdant plain of
Cos, with the white houses and trees of the town
to the right, and the wide expanse of turquoise sea
dotted by the purple islands of the &AElig;gean, and
the dim mountains about Halicarnassus, to the
north-east."<a name="FNanchor_II_3" id="FNanchor_II_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_II_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Greek Gymnasia were in use long
before the Asclepiades began to practise in the
temples. The Greeks were a healthy and strong
race, mainly because they attended to physical
culture as a national duty. The attendants
who massaged the bodies of the athletes were
called <i>alipt&aelig;</i>, and they also taught physical exercises,
and practised minor surgery and medicine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Massage was used before and after exercises in the
gymnasium, and was performed by anointing the
body with a mixture of oil and sand which was
well rubbed into the skin. There were three
classes of officials in the gymnasia; the director
or magistrate called the <i>gymnasiarch</i>, the sub-director
or <i>gymnast</i>, and the subordinates. The
directors regulated the diet of the young men, the
<i>sub-directors</i>, besides other duties, prescribed for the
sick, and the attendants massaged, bled, dressed
wounds, gave clysters, and treated abscesses, dislocations,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Greeks, in insisting
upon the physical training of the young, were wiser
in their generation than the people of the present
day; and not only the young, but people of mature
age, took exercises suited to their physical requirements.
The transgression of some of Solon's laws
in reference to the gymnasia was punishable by
death.</p>

<p>The third stage in the history of Greek medicine
has now been reached. The first stage was primitive,
the second associated with religion, and
the third connected with philosophy. The classification
of Renouard is accurate and convenient.
In the "Age of Foundation," he recognizes four
periods, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The Primitive Period, or that of Instinct,
beginning with myth, and ending with the destruction
of Troy, 1184 years before Christ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The Sacred or Mystic Period, ending with
the dispersion of the Pythagorean Society, 500
years before Christ.</p>

<p>(3) The Philosophic Period, ending with the
foundation of the Alexandrian library, 320 years
before Christ. This period is made illustrious by
Hippocrates.</p>

<p>(4) The Anatomic Period, ending with the death
of Galen, about 200 years after Christ.</p>

<p>The earliest Greek medical philosopher was
Pythagoras (about 580 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>). He was born at
Samos, and began life as an athlete, but a lecture
which he heard on the subject of the immortality
of the soul kindled enthusiasm for philosophical
study, the pursuit of which led him to visit Egypt,
Ph&oelig;nicia, Chaldea, and perhaps also India. He
was imbued with Eastern mysticism, and held
that the air is full of spiritual beings who send
dreams to men, and health or disease to mankind
and to the lower animals. He did not remain long
in Greece, but travelled much, and settled for a
considerable time in Crotona, in the South of
Italy, where he taught pupils, their course of study
extending over five or six years. The Pythagorean
Society founded by him did much good at first,
but its members ultimately became greedy of gain
and dishonest, and the Society in the lifetime of
its founder was subjected to persecution and dispersed
by angry mobs. Pythagoras possessed a
prodigious mind. He is best known for his teaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in reference to the transmigration of souls, but he
was also a great mathematician and astronomer.
He taught that "number is the essence of everything,"
and his philosophy recognized that the
universe is governed by law. God he represented
by the figure 1, matter by the figure 2, and the
universe by the combination 12, all of which,
though fanciful, was an improvement upon mythology,
and a recognition of system.</p>

<p>In the practice of medicine he promoted health
mainly by diet and gymnastics, advised music for
depression of spirits, and had in use various
vegetable drugs. He introduced oxymel of squills
from Egypt into Greece, and was a strong believer
in the medicinal properties of onions. He viewed
surgery with disfavour, and used only salves and
poultices. The Asclepiades treated patients in the
temples, but the Pythagoreans visited from house
to house, and from city to city, and were known
as the ambulant or periodic physicians.</p>

<p>Herodotus gives an account of another eminent
physician of Crotona, <i>Democedes</i> by name, who
succeeded Pythagoras. At this time, it is recorded
that the various cities had public medical officers.
Democedes gained his freedom from slavery as a
reward for curing the wife of Darius of an abscess
in the breast.</p>

<p>The dispersal of the Pythagoreans led to the
settlement of many of them, and of their imitators,
in Rome and various parts of Italy. Although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Pythagoras was a philosopher, he belongs to the
Mystic Period, while Hippocrates is the great
central figure of the Philosophic Period. Before
studying the work of Hippocrates, it is necessary
to consider the distinguishing features of the
various schools of Greek philosophy. Renouard
shows that the principles of the various schools
of medical belief depended upon the three great
Greek schools of Cosmogony.</p>

<p>Pythagoras believed in a Supreme Ruler of the
Universe, and that spirits animated all life, and
existed even in minerals; he also believed in
preconceived purpose. With these views were
associated the Dogmatic School of Medicine, and
the name of Hippocrates, and this belief corresponds
to modern vitalism.</p>

<p>Leucippus and Democritus, rejecting theology,
considered vital action secondary to the operation
of the laws of matter, and believed that atoms
moved through pores in the body in such a way as
to determine a state of health or disease. With
this philosophy was associated the Medical School
of Methodism, a system said to have been founded
by Asclepiades of Prusa (who lived in Rome in the
first century before Christ), and by his pupil
Themison (<span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> 50). The third school of medical
thought, that of Empiricism, taught that experience
was the only teacher, and that it was idle to
speculate upon remote causes. The Empirics
based these views upon the teaching of philosophers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
known as Sceptics or Zetetics, followers of Parmenides
and Pyrrho, who taught that it was useless
to fatigue the mind in endeavouring to comprehend
what is beyond its range. They were the precursors
of modern agnosticism.</p>

<p>The Eclectics, in a later age, formed another
medical sect, and had no definite system except
that they made a selection of the views and
methods of Dogmatists, Methodists and Empirics.</p>

<p>The Greek philosophers as a class believed in
a primary form of matter out of which elements
were formed, and the view held in regard to the
elements is expressed in Ovid's "Metamorphoses."<a name="FNanchor_II_4" id="FNanchor_II_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_II_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor those which elements we call abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to this figure nor to that are ty'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this eternal world is said of old<br /></span>

<h3>HIPPOCRATES.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">His life and works &mdash; His influence on Medicine.</p></div>

<p><i>Hippocrates</i>, the Father of Medicine, was born at
Cos during the golden age of Greece, 460 years before
Christ. He belonged to the family of the Asclepiad&aelig;,
and, according to tradition, could trace his
ancestors on the male side to &AElig;sculapius, and on
the female side to Hercules. He is said to have
received his medical education from his father and
from Herodicus, and to have been taught philosophy
by Gorgias, the Sophist, and by Democritus, whom
he afterwards cured of mental derangement.</p>

<p>There was a very famous medical school at Cos,
and the temple there held the notes of the accumulated
experience of his predecessors, but Hippocrates
visited also, for the purpose of study, various towns
of Greece, and particularly Athens. He was a
keen observer, and took careful notes of his observations.
His reputation was such that his works
are quoted by Plato and by Aristotle, and there
are references to him by Arabic writers. His
descendants published their own writings under
his name, and there were also many forgeries, so
that it is impossible to know exactly how many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the works attributed to him are authentic; but by
a consensus of opinion the following books are
considered genuine: "Prognostics," seven of the
books of "Aphorisms," "On Airs, Waters and
Places," "On Regimen in Acute Diseases," the
first and third books of "Epidemics," "On the
Articulations," "On Fractures," the treatise on
"Instruments of Reduction," and "The Oath";
and the books considered almost certainly genuine
are those dealing with "Ancient Medicine,"
"Surgery," "The Law," "Fistul&aelig;," "Ulcers,"
"H&aelig;morrhoids," and "On the Sacred Disease"
(Epilepsy). The famous Hippocratic Collection
in the great libraries of Alexandria and Pergamos
also comprised the writings of Pythagoras, Plato
and Aristotle.</p>

<p>The genius of Hippocrates is unsurpassed in
the history of medicine. He was the first to
trace disease to a natural and intelligible cause,
and to recognize Nature as all-sufficient for healing,
and physicians as only her servants. He discussed
medical subjects freely and without an air
of mystery, scorning all pretence, and he was
also courageous enough to acknowledge his limitations
and his failures. When the times in which
he lived are considered, it is difficult to know which
of his qualities to admire most, his love of knowledge,
his powers of observation, his logical faculty,
or his courage and truthfulness.</p>

<p>The central principle of belief of Hippocrates and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the Dogmatists was that health depended on the
proper proportion and action in the body of the
four elements, earth, water, air, and fire, and the
four cardinal humours, blood, phlegm, yellow
bile and black bile. The due combination of
these was known as <i>crasis</i>, and existed in health.
If a disease were progressing favourably these
humours became changed and combined (coction),
preparatory to the expulsion of the morbid matter
(crisis), which took place at definite periods known
as critical days. Hippocrates also held the theory
of fluxions, which were conditions in the nature of
congestion, as it would now be understood.</p>

<p>In his time public opinion condemned dissection
of the human body, but it is certain that dissections
were performed by Hippocrates to a limited extent.
He did not know the difference between the arteries
and the veins, and nerves and ligaments and various
membranes were all thought to have analogous
functions, but his writings display a correct knowledge
of the anatomy of certain parts of the body
such as the joints and the brain. This defective
knowledge of anatomy gave rise to fanciful views
on physiology, which, among much that is admirable,
disfigure the Hippocratic writings.</p>

<p>The belief that almost all medical and surgical
knowledge is modern, though flattering to our
self-complacency, is disturbed by the study of the
state of knowledge in the time of Hippocrates.
To him we are indebted for the classification of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
diseases into sporadic, epidemic, and endemic, and
he also separated acute from chronic diseases.
He divided the causes of disease into two classes:
general, such as climate, water and sanitation;
and personal, such as improper food and neglect
of exercise.</p>

<p>He based his conclusions on the observation of
appearances, and in this way began a new era. He
was so perfect in the observation of external signs
of disease that he has never in this respect been
excelled. The state of the face, eyes, tongue,
voice, hearing, abdomen, sleep, breathing, excretions,
posture of the body, and so on, all aided him
in diagnosis and prognosis, and to the latter
he paid special attention, saying that "the best
physician is the one who is able to establish a
prognosis, penetrating and exposing first of all,
at the bedside, the present, the past, and the future
of his patients, and adding what they omit in their
statements. He gains their confidence, and being
convinced of his superiority of knowledge they do
not hesitate to commit themselves entirely into his
hands. He can treat, also, so much better their
present condition in proportion as he shall be able
from it to foresee the future."</p>

<p>He wrote about the history of Medicine, a study
which is much neglected at the present time.
There is no generation of men so wise that they
cannot with advantage adopt some ideas from the
remote past, or, at least, find the teaching of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
predecessors suggestive. Hippocrates was one of
the first to recognize the <i>vis medicatrix natur&aelig;</i>, and
he always aimed at assisting Nature. His style
of treatment would be known now as expectant,
and he tried to order his practice "to do good, or,
at least, to do no harm." When he considered
interference necessary, however, he did not hesitate
even to apply drastic measures, such as scarification,
cupping and bleeding. He made use of
the narcotics mandragora, henbane, and probably
also poppy-juice, and as a laxative used greatly
a vegetable substance called "mercury," beet and
cabbage, and cathartics such as scammony and
elaterium! He was able to diagnose fluid in the
chest or abdomen by means of percussion and
auscultation, and to withdraw the fluid by the
operation of paracentesis, and he recognized also
that the fluid should be allowed to flow away
slowly so as to minimize the risk of syncope. He
operated also for empyema. In regard to the
methods of Hippocrates for the physical examination
of the chest it is reasonable to suppose that
the Father of Medicine indirectly inspired Laennec
to invent the stethoscope. Hippocrates prescribed
fluid diet for fevers, allowed the patients cold
water or barley water to drink, and recommended
cold sponging for high fever. In his writings will
be found his views on apoplexy, epilepsy, phthisis,
gout, erysipelas, cancer and many other diseases
common at the present day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>In the province of <i>Surgery</i>, Hippocrates was
surprisingly proficient, although he lived before
the Anatomic Period. He had various lotions
for the healing of ulcers; some of these lotions
were antiseptic and have been in use in recent
times. His opinions on the treatment of fractures
are sound, and he was a master in the use of splints,
and considered that it was disgraceful on the part
of the surgeon to allow a broken limb to set in a
faulty position. He resected the projecting ends
of the bone in the case of compound fracture. He
had a very complete knowledge of the anatomy of
joints, was well acquainted with hip-joint disease,
and could operate upon joints. Accidents were no
doubt common in the gymnasia, and practice in
the treatment of fractures and dislocations extensive
and of a high order of excellence. Hippocrates
used the sound for exploring the bladder, and
understood the use of the speculum for examining
the rectum, and in operations for fistula and
piles. He understood the causation of club-foot,
and could cure cases of this deformity by bandaging.
He was skilful also in obstetric operations.
He trepanned the skull, which appears to have
been a common operation in his day. He had
clear and sound views in reference to wounds of
the head, recognizing that trivial-looking wounds
of the scalp might become very serious. Hippocrates
gave directions as to the indications for
using the trepan, and warned the operator against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mistaking sutures of the cranial bones for
fracture.</p>

<p>He did not describe amputations as generally
understood, but removed limbs at a joint for gangrene.
When necessary he made use of mechanical
appliances for reducing dislocations, and recommended
doctors to furnish their surgeries with an
adjustable table, fitted with levers, for dealing with
the reduction of dislocations, and for various other
surgical manipulations. Excision of tumours was
not a common operation of Hippocratic surgery,
although it had been a part of Hindu practice in
very ancient times. On the subject of <i>Obstetrics</i>,
Hippocrates wrote a great deal, and although many
of his theories seem absurd at the present day, yet,
on the whole, the treatment he recommends is
efficacious. Regarding <i>Gyn&aelig;cology</i>, in his treatise
on "Airs, Water and Places," it is interesting to
observe that he says that the drinking of impure
water will cause dropsy of the uterus. Adams,
commenting on this, has in mind hydatids, but it
is evident that both Hippocrates and his translator
and critic have mistaken hydatidiform disease of
the ovum for hydatid disease of the womb. In the
books which are considered genuine the references
to diseases of women are meagre, and it is likely
that the author had little special knowledge of the
subject. That part of the Hippocratic collection
which is not considered genuine deals rather fully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
with the subject of gyn&aelig;cology.<a name="FNanchor_III_1" id="FNanchor_III_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_III_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In it are described
sounds made of wood and of lead, dilators
and uterine catheters. Sitz baths were in use,
and fumigations were very extensively employed
in gyn&aelig;cological practice. Pessaries were made
by rolling lint or wool into an oblong shape, and
were medicated to be emollient, astringent or
purgative in their local action. The half of a
pomegranate was used as a mechanical pessary,
and there are also references to tents, and to
suppositories for the bowel.</p>

<p>In dealing with <i>Dietetics</i>, Hippocrates displays
close observation and sound judgment. The views
held generally at the present day coincide closely
with his instructions on food and feeding. In the
treatise on Ancient Medicine, he states that men
had to find from experience the properties of
various vegetable foods, and discovered that what
was suitable in health was unsuitable in sickness,
and that the accumulation of these discoveries was
the origin of the art of medicine.</p>

<p>The Sydenham Society initiated, and Dr. Adams
brilliantly accomplished, a noble work in the publication
in 1849 of "The Genuine Works of Hippocrates,"
from which "The Law," and "The Oath"
are here quoted. The former is the view of Hippocrates
of the standards which should govern the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
practice of medicine; the latter is that by which
all the &AElig;sculapians were bound.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">"The Law</span>.</h4>

<p>"(1) Medicine is of all the arts the most noble;
but, owing to the ignorance of those who practise
it, and of those who, inconsiderately, form a judgment
of them, it is at present far behind all the
other arts. Their mistake appears to me to arise
principally from this, that in the cities there is no
punishment connected with the practice of medicine
(and with it alone) except disgrace, and that
does not hurt those who are familiar with it.
Such persons are like the figures which are introduced
in tragedies, for as they have the shape,
and dress, and personal appearance of an actor,
but are not actors, so also physicians are many in
title but very few in reality.</p>

<p>"(2) Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge
of medicine, ought to be possessed of the
following advantages: A natural disposition; instruction;
a favourable position for the study; early
tuition; love of labour; leisure. First of all, a
natural talent is required, for, when Nature opposes,
everything else is vain; but when Nature leads the
way to what is most excellent, instruction in the
art takes place, which the student must try to
appropriate to himself by reflection, becoming an
early pupil in a place well adapted for instruction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
He must also bring to the task a love of labour
and perseverance, so that the instruction taking
root may bring forth proper and abundant fruits.</p>

<p>"(3) Instruction in medicine is like the culture
of the productions of the earth. For our natural
disposition is, as it were, the soil; the tenets of
our teacher are, as it were, the seed; instruction
in youth is like the planting of the seed in the
ground at the proper season; the place where the
instruction is communicated is like the food imparted
to vegetables by the atmosphere; diligent
study is like the cultivation of the fields; and it is
time which imparts strength to all things and
brings them to maturity.</p>

<p>"(4) Having brought all these requisites to the
study of medicine, and having acquired a true
knowledge of it, we shall thus, in travelling
through the cities, be esteemed physicians not
only in name but in reality. But inexperience is
a bad treasure, and a bad friend to those who
possess it, whether in opinion or reality, being
devoid of self-reliance and contentedness, and the
nurse both of timidity and audacity. For timidity
betrays a want of powers, and audacity a want of
skill. There are, indeed, two things, knowledge
and opinion, of which the one makes its possessor
really to know, the other to be ignorant.</p>

<p>"(5) These things which are sacred are to be
imparted only to sacred persons; and it is not
lawful to impart them to the profane until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
they have been initiated in the mysteries of the
science."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">"The Oath</span>.</h4>

<p>"I swear by Apollo, the physician, and &AElig;sculapius,
and Health, and Panacea, and all the gods
and goddesses, that, according to my ability and
judgment, I will keep this oath and this stipulation&mdash;to
reckon him who taught me this art
equally dear to me as my parents, to share my
substance with him, and relieve his necessities if
required; to look upon his offspring in the same
footing as my own brothers, and to teach them
this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee
or stipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and
every other mode of instruction, I will impart a
knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and those
of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation
and oath according to the law of medicine,
but to none others. I will follow that system of
regimen which, according to my ability and judgment,
I consider for the benefit of my patients,
and abstain from whatever is deleterious and
mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to
anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel;
and in like manner I will not give to a woman a
pessary to produce abortion. With purity and
with holiness I will pass my life and practise my
Art. I will not cut persons labouring under the
stone, but will leave this to be done by men who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
are practitioners of this work. Into whatever
houses I enter, I will go into them for the benefit
of the sick, and will abstain from every voluntary
act of mischief and corruption, and, further, from
the seduction of females or males, of freedmen and
slaves. Whatever, in connection with my professional
practice, or not in connection with it, I
see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to
be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge as reckoning
that all such should be kept secret. While I
continue to keep this Oath inviolate, may it be
granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the
Art, respected by all men, in all times! But
should I trespass or violate this oath, may the
reverse be my lot!"</p>

<p>It would be a great task to attempt anything
like a full review of the writings of this great
doctor of antiquity, but enough has been written
to reveal the great powers of his mind, and to
show that he was far in advance of his predecessors,
and a model for his successors. In the island of
Cos, made illustrious by the name of Hippocrates,
it is strange to find that he has no fame now
other than that of being regarded in the confused
minds of the people as one of the numerous saints
of the Greek Church.<a name="FNanchor_III_2" id="FNanchor_III_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_III_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"When," says Littr&eacute;, "one searches into the
history of medicine and the commencement of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
science, the first body of doctrine that one meets
with is the collection of writings known under the
name of the works of Hippocrates. The science
mounts up directly to that origin, and there
stops. Not that it had not been cultivated
earlier, and had not given rise to even numerous
productions; but everything that had been made
before the physician of Cos has perished. We
have only remaining of them scattered and unconnected
fragments. The works of Hippocrates
have alone escaped destruction; and by a singular
circumstance there exists a great gap after them
as well as before them. The medical works from
Hippocrates to the establishment of the School of
Alexandria, and those of that school itself, are
completely lost, except some quotations and
passages preserved in the later writers; so that
the writings of Hippocrates remain alone amongst
the ruins of ancient medical literature." Sydenham
said of Hippocrates: "He it is whom we can never
duly praise," and refers to him as "that divine old
man," and "the Romulus of medicine, whose
heaven was the empyrean of his art."</p>

<p>Hippocrates died in Thessaly, but at what age
is uncertain, for different authors have credited him
with a lifetime of from eighty-five to a hundred
and nine years. By virtue of his fame, death for
him was not the Great Leveller.</p>

<p>Hippocrates had two sons, Thessalus and
Draco; the former was physician to Archelaus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
King of Macedonia, the latter physician to the
wife of Alexander the Great. They were the
founders of the School of Dogmatism which was
based mainly on the teaching and aphorisms of
Hippocrates. The Dogmatic Sect emphasized the
importance of investigating not the obvious but
the underlying and hidden causes of disease and
held undisputed sway until the foundation of the
Empirical Sect at Alexandria.</p>

<h3>PLATO, ARISTOTLE, THE SCHOOL OF ALEXANDRIA
AND EMPIRICISM.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Plato &mdash; Aristotle &mdash; Alexandrian School &mdash; Its Origin &mdash;  Its
Influence &mdash; Lithotomy &mdash; Herophilus &mdash; Erasistratus &mdash; Cleombrotus &mdash; Chrysippos &mdash; Anatomy &mdash; Empiricism &mdash; Serapion
of Alexandria.</p></div>

<p>Two very eminent philosophers, Plato and
Aristotle, were influenced by the teaching of
Hippocrates.</p>

<p><i>Plato</i> (<span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> 427-347) was a profound moralist, and
though possessed of one of the keenest intellects
of all time, did little to advance medical science.
He did not practise medicine, but studied it as a
branch of philosophy, and instead of observing and
investigating, attempted to solve the problems of
health and disease by intuition and speculation.
His conceptions were inaccurate and fantastic.</p>

<p>He elaborated the humoral pathology of
Hippocrates. The world, he thought, was composed
of four elements: <i>fire</i> consisting of pyramidal,
<i>earth</i> of cubical, <i>air</i> of octagonal, and <i>water</i> of
twenty-sided atoms. The marrow consists of
triangles, and the brain is the perfection of marrow.
The soul dominates the marrow and the separation
of the two causes death. The purpose of the bones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and muscles is to protect the marrow against
changes of temperature. Plato divided the "soul"
into three parts: Reason, enthroned in the brain;
courage in the heart; and desire in the liver. The
uterus, he believed, excites inordinate desires.
Inflammations are due to disorders of the bile, and
fevers to the influence of the elements. His
theories in regard to the special senses are very
fantastic, for instance, smell is evanescent because
it is not founded on any external image; taste
results from small vessels carrying taste atoms to
the heart and soul.</p>

<p><i>Aristotle</i>, born <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> 334, was the son of Nichomachus,
physician to the King of Macedonia, and
of the race of the Asclepiads. His inherited taste
was for the study of Nature; he attained the
great honour of being the founder of the
sciences of Comparative Anatomy and Natural
History, and contributed largely to the medical
knowledge of his time. Aristotle went to Athens
and became a follower of Plato, and the close
companionship of these two great men lasted for
twenty years. At the age of 42, Aristotle
was appointed by Philip of Macedon tutor to
Alexander the Great, who was then aged 15,
and the interest of that mighty prince was
soon aroused in the study of Natural History.
Aristotle and Alexander the Great, teacher and
pupil, founded the first great Natural History
Museum, to which specimens were sent from places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
scattered over the then known world. Aristotle,
besides his philosophical books, wrote: "Researches
about Animals," "On Sleep and Waking,"
"On Longevity and Shortlivedness," "On Parts of
Animals," "On Respiration," "On Locomotion of
Animals," and "On Generation of Animals." He
was greatly helped in the supply of material for
dissection in his study of comparative anatomy
by his pupil, Alexander the Great. Aristotle
pointed out the differences in the anatomy of
men and monkeys; he described the anatomy of
the elephant and of birds, and also the changes
in development seen during the incubation of eggs.
He investigated, also, the anatomy of fishes and
reptiles. The stomachs of ruminant animals excited
his interest, and he described their structure.
The heart, according to Aristotle, was the seat of
the soul, and the birthplace of the passions, for it
held the natural fire, and in it centred movement,
sensation and nourishment. The diaphragm, he
believed, separated the heart, the seat of the soul,
from the contaminating influences of the intestines.
He did not advance beyond the conception that
nerves were akin to ligaments and tendons, and he
believed that the nerves originated in the heart, as
did also the blood-vessels. He named the <i>aorta</i>
and <i>ventricles</i>. He investigated the action of the
muscles, and held that superf&oelig;tation was possible.</p>

<p>When Aristotle retired to Chalcis, he chose
Tyrtamus, to whom he gave the name of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
<i>Theophrastus</i>, as his successor at the Lyceum.
Theophrastus was the originator of the science
of Botany, and wrote the "History of Plants."
He also wrote about stones, and on physical, moral
and medical subjects.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Alexandrian School</span>.</h4>

<p>"In the year 331 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>," wrote Kingsley, "one of
the greatest intellects whose influence the world
has ever felt, saw, with his eagle glance, the
unrivalled advantages of the spot which is now
Alexandria, and conceived the mighty project of
making it the point of union of two, or rather of
three worlds. In a new city named after himself,
Europe, Asia and Africa were to meet and hold
communion." The School of Alexandria became,
after the decay of Greek culture, the centre of
learning for the world, and when the Empire of
Alexander the Great was subdivided, the Egyptian
share fell to the first Ptolemy, who, under the
direction of Aristotle, founded the Alexandrian
Library, containing at first fifty thousand, and
finally seven hundred thousand volumes. Every
student who came to the University of Alexandria,
and possessed a book of which there was not a copy
in the Alexandrian Library, was compelled to
present the book to the library. The first Ptolemy
also fostered the study of medicine and of dissection.
Eumenes likewise established a library at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Pergamos. It is instructive to follow the history
of the great Library of Alexandria. The greater
part of the library, which contained the collected
literature of Greece, Rome, India and Egypt, was
housed in the famous museum in the part of
Alexandria called the Brucheion. This part was
destroyed by fire during the siege of Alexandria by
Julius C&aelig;sar. Mark Antony, then, at the urgent
desire of Cleopatra, transferred to Alexandria the
books and manuscripts from Pergamos. The other
part of the library was kept at Alexandria in the
Serapeum, the temple of Jupiter Serapis, and there
it remained till the time of Theodosius the Great,
until in 391 <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> both temple and library were
almost completely destroyed by a fanatical mob of
Christians led by the Archbishop Theophilus. When
Alexandria was taken by the Arabs in 641, under
the Calif Omar, the destruction was completed.</p>

<p>Ptolemy gathered to the museum at Alexandria a
number of very learned men, who lived within its
walls and were provided with salaries, the whole
system closely resembling a university. Grammar,
prosody, mythology, astronomy and philosophy
were studied, and great attention was given to
the study of medicine. Euclid was the teacher
of Mathematics, and Hipparchus of Alexandria
was the father of Astronomy. The teaching of
medicine and of astronomy was for long based upon
observation of ascertained facts. The Alexandrian
School endured for close upon a thousand years,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and its history may be divided into two periods,
namely, from 323 to 30 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, during the period of the
Ptolemies, and from 30 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> to 640 <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> The second
period was distinguished for the study of speculative
philosophy, and of the religious philosophy of the
Gnostics, and was not a scientific period.</p>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar was not the only Roman Emperor
who brought trouble upon the Alexandrian School,
for the brutal Caracalla took away the salaries and
privileges from the <i>savants</i>, and prohibited scientific
exhibitions and discussions. In recent excavations
in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome, the ruins of a
library have been discovered, and it is believed by
some arch&aelig;ologists that Caracalla supplied this
library with books and parchments from Alexandria.</p>

<p>The Asclepiad&aelig; of Cos and Cnidos had discoursed
upon the phenomena of disease, without
attempting to demonstrate its structural relations;
like the sculptors of their own age, they studied the
changing expression of vital action almost wholly
from an external point of view. They meddled
not with the dead, for, by their own laws, no one
was allowed to die within the temple. But the
early Alexandrians were subject to no such restrictions;
and turning to good account the discoveries
of Aristotle in natural history and comparative
anatomy, they undertook for the first time to
describe the organization of the human frame
from actual dissections.<a name="FNanchor_IV_1" id="FNanchor_IV_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_IV_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus there was inaugurated at Alexandria the
Anatomic Period of Medicine, which lasted till
Egypt came under the sway of the Romans.
Medical practice became so flourishing at Alexandria
that three great specialities were established,
namely, Surgery, Pharmacy, and Dietetics, and a
great variety of operations were performed.
Lithotomy was much practised by specialists.
A foul murder was perpetrated by lithotomists
at the instigation of Diodotus, the guardian of
Antiochus, son of Alexander, King of Syria
(150 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>), young Antiochus, at the age of 10,
being done to death under the pretence that he
had a stone in his bladder.</p>

<p>About 150 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> a sect called the Essenes was
established for the study of curative and poisonous
substances. The members were not all physicians,
by any means, for one of the chief was King
Mithridates, who invented the remedy known as
mithridaticum. This celebrated nostrum of
antiquity is said to have been a confection of
twenty leaves of rue, a few grains of salt, two
walnuts, and two figs, intended to be taken every
morning and followed by a draught of wine.</p>

<p>Two famous physicians and anatomists,
<i>Herophilus</i> (335-280 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>) and <i>Erasistratus</i> (280
<span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>) took part in the medical teaching at Alexandria
in the early days of that seat of learning. It is
recorded that they did not confine their investigations
to the dissection of the dead, but also vivisected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
criminals. <i>Cleombrotus</i>, another physician at this
school, was sent for to attend King Antiochus,
and was rewarded with a hundred talents, equal
to about &pound;15,000 sterling.</p>

<p>There were several physicians of the name of
<i>Chrysippos</i> connected with the Alexandrian School.
One was physician to Ptolemy Soter, the King
of Egypt, and tutor to Erasistratus. This
Chrysippos introduced the practice of emptying a
limb of blood before amputation, according to the
recent method of Esmarch, and is said to have
employed vapour baths in the treatment of dropsy.</p>

<p>In Alexandria, anatomy was properly studied.<a name="FNanchor_IV_2" id="FNanchor_IV_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_IV_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><i>Herophilus</i> made many anatomical discoveries,
and some of the names he gave to parts of the
body are now in use, for instance, torcular
Herophili, calamus scriptorius, and duodenum.
He described the connection between the nerves
and the brain, and the various parts of the brain,
and recognized the essential difference between
motor and sensory nerves, although he thought
the former arose in the membranes and the latter
in the substance of the brain. He believed that
the fourth ventricle was the seat of the soul. He
attributed to the heart the pulsations of the
arteries, but thought that the pulmonary veins
conveyed air from the lungs to the left side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the heart, and he observed the lacteals without
determining their function. Herophilus operated
upon the liver and spleen, and looked upon the
latter as of little consequence in the animal
economy. He had a good knowledge of obstetric
operations. His ideas in relation to pathology
did not proceed much further than the belief
that disease was due to corruption of the humors.
He was more scientific and accurate when he
taught that paralysis results from a defect in the
nerves.</p>

<p><i>Erasistratus</i> studied under Chrysippos (or
Chrysippus), and under Metrodorus, the son-in-law
of Aristotle. Herophilus had been a student
at Cos, Erasistratus at Cnidos, so that the
teaching of the two great Greek medical schools
was introduced into Alexandria. Xenophon, of
Cos, one of the followers of Erasistratus, first
resorted to the ligation of vessels for the arrest
of h&aelig;morrhage, although for many years in later
times this important practice was lost through the
neglect of the study of the history of medicine.
Erasistratus and Herophilus, it is sad to relate,
considered that vivisection of human beings, as
well as dissection of the dead, was a necessary part
of medical education, and believed that the
sufferings of a few criminals did not weigh against
the benefit likely to accrue to innocent people,
who could be relieved or cured of disease and
suffering as the result of the knowledge gained by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
dissection of the living. This cruel and nefarious
practice was followed "so that the investigators
could study the particular organs during life in
regard to position, colour, form, size, disposition,
hardness, softness, smoothness, and superficial
extent, their projection and curvatures."</p>

<p>The followers of these teachers, unfortunately,
became very speculative and fond of discussions
of a fruitless kind, and, according to Pliny, it was
easier "to sit and listen quietly in the schools than
to be up and wandering over the deserts, and to
seek out new plants every day,"<a name="FNanchor_IV_3" id="FNanchor_IV_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_IV_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and so, in the
third century before Christ, the school of
<i>Empiricism</i> was established, the system of which
resembled the older Scepticism. It rested upon the
"Empiric tripod," namely, accident, history and
analogy. This meant that discoveries were made
by accident, knowledge was accumulated by the
recollection of previous cases, and treatment
adopted which had been found suitable in similar
circumstances. <i>Philinus of Cos</i>, a pupil of
Herophilus, declared that all the anatomy he had
learned from his master did not help him in the
least to cure diseases. Philinus, according to Galen,
founded the Empirici, the first schismatic sect in
medicine. Celsus<a name="FNanchor_IV_4" id="FNanchor_IV_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_IV_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> wrote of this sect that they
admit that evident causes are necessary, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
deprecate inquiry into them because Nature is
incomprehensible. This is proved because the
philosophers and physicians who have spent so
much labour in trying to search out these occult
causes cannot agree amongst themselves. If
reasoning could make physicians, the philosophers
should be most successful practitioners, as they
have such abundance of words. If the causes of
diseases were the same in all places, the same
remedies ought to be used everywhere. Relief
from sickness is to be sought from things certain
and tried, that is from experience, which guides
us in all other arts. Husbandmen and pilots
do not reason about their business, but they
practise it. Disquisitions can have no connection
with medicine, because physicians whose opinions
have been directly opposed to one another have
equally restored their patients to health; they did
not derive their methods of cure from studying the
occult causes about which they disputed, but from
the experience they had of the remedies which
they employed upon their patients. Medicine was
not first discovered in consequence of reasoning,
but the theory was sought for after the discovery
of medicine. Does reason, they ask, prescribe the
same as experience, or something different? If the
same, it must be needless; if different, it must be
mischievous.</p>

<p>In the third and second centuries before Christ,
many physicians wrote commentaries on diseases<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and attacked the teaching of Hippocrates. Among
these, <i>Serapion of Alexandria</i>, an Empiric who
lived in the third century before Christ, is noteworthy
for having first used sulphur in the treatment
of skin diseases, and Heraclides wrote on
strangulated hernia. Serapion added somewhat to
the system of Philinus, and was responsible for
introducing the principle of analogy into the system
of Empiricism. The foundation of Empiricism
marked the decline of the medical school of
Alexandria. We are indebted to Celsus for a full
description of the teaching of this sect, and, at
the same time, for an exposure of its fallacies.
Serapion was a convert from the school of Cos,
which was the stronghold of medical dogmatism,
and, like nearly all apostates, he was consumed with
animosity and bitterness towards those with whom
he had formerly been in agreement. Cnidos was
the stronghold of the Empirics.</p>

<h3>ROMAN MEDICINE AT THE END OF THE REPUBLIC
AND THE BEGINNING OF THE EMPIRE.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Asclepiades of Prusa &mdash; Themison of Laodicea &mdash; Methodism &mdash; Wounds
of Julius C&aelig;sar &mdash; Systems of Philosophy &mdash; State
of the country &mdash; Roman quacks &mdash; Slaves and Freedmen &mdash; Lucius
Horatillavus.</p></div>

<p><i>Asclepiades of Prusa</i>, in Bithynia, was a famous
physician in Rome early in the first century before
Christ. He studied both rhetoric and medicine at
Alexandria and at Athens. He began as a teacher
of rhetoric in Rome, but, although he was the friend
of Cicero, he was not very successful, and abandoned
this study for the practice of medicine. He had a
great deal of ability and shrewdness, but no knowledge
of anatomy or physiology, and he condemned
all who thought that these subjects of study were
the foundation of the healing art. He specially
inveighed against Hippocrates, and with some
reason, for the disciples of Hippocrates had elevated
the teaching of their master almost into a religion,
and were bound far too closely to his authority, to
the exclusion of original thought and progress.</p>

<p>Asclepiades had many pupils, and his teaching
led to the foundation of the Medical School of
the Methodists. His most important maxim was
that a cure should be effected "<i>tuto, celeriter, ac
jucunde</i>," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>and he believed that what the physician
could do was of primary importance, and <i>vis
medicatrix natur&aelig;</i> only secondary. He was thus
directly opposed to the teaching of Hippocrates.
He had little or no faith in drugs, and relied
mainly upon diet, exercises and massage, and, to
some extent, upon surgery. His practice of prescribing
wine in liberal doses added to his popularity.
It was the custom to take wine very much diluted
with water, but Asclepiades ordered wine in full
strength or only slightly diluted. He practised
bronchotomy and tracheotomy, and recommended
in suitable cases of dropsy scarification of the
ankles, and advised that, in tapping, an opening
as small as possible should be made. He also
observed spontaneous dislocation of the hip. He
was a very famous man in the Roman Republic,
and was well acquainted with philosophy, especially
the philosophy of the Epicureans. Although
he was almost entirely ignorant of anatomy,
he was far from being a quack. He had
great powers of observation and natural shrewdness,
and his success largely contributed to
the establishment of Greek doctors and their
methods in Rome. There is grim humour in his
description of the Hippocratic treatise on therapeutics,
which he called "a meditation on death."
Pliny relates that Asclepiades wagered that he
would never die of disease, and he won the wager,
for he lived to old age and died of an accident!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Themison, of Laodicea</i>, lived in the first
century before Christ, and was a pupil of
Asclepiades of Prusa, the founder of the School
of Methodism. His views on atoms and pores
led him to adopt a very simple explanation of
health and disease, for he considered that these
pores must be either constricted or dilated, and the
aim of the physician should be to dilate the constriction,
and <i>vice versa</i>. This epitomized system
of medicine did away with the use of many classes
of drugs, and, from its simplicity, was quickly
learned. A jeering opponent of the system of the
Methodici said that it could be taught in six
months, and Galen, in later years, ridiculed it,
and called its practitioners "the asses of Thessaly."</p>

<p>The great fault of Dogmatism was its absolute
reliance on the wisdom of Hippocrates, and
Methodism was marred by its insufficiency and
sophistry.</p>

<p>In spite of his extravagant theories, Themison
possessed skill in practice. He was the first
physician to describe rheumatism, and he also is
thought to have been the pioneer in the medicinal
use of leeches. A book on elephantiasis ascribed
to him is not definitely known to be authentic.
It is worthy of note that he was anxious to write
on hydrophobia, but a case he had seen in early
youth so impressed his mind with horror that the
mere thought of the disease caused him to suffer
some of the symptoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The views of the Methodists were less extreme
than those of the Dogmatists and Empirics. Celsus
wrote of the Methodists: "They assert that the
knowledge of no cause whatever bears the least
relation to the method of cure; and that it is
sufficient to observe some general symptoms of
distempers; and that there are three kinds of
diseases, one bound, another loose, and the third
is a mixture of these."<a name="FNanchor_V_1" id="FNanchor_V_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There were several physicians of the name of
Themison at different times, and it is probably the
founder of the Methodici who was satirized by
Juvenal thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How many patients Themison dispatched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one short autumn."<a name="FNanchor_V_2" id="FNanchor_V_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The joke which is based on attributing a cure to
Nature alone, and death solely to the physician's
want of skill, is one of the most time-honoured.</p>

<p>Themison lived at the close of the Roman
Republic, and it will now be necessary to consider
the state of the healing art in Rome under the rule
of the emperors.</p>

<p>Julius C&aelig;sar&mdash;one of the first triumvirate&mdash;invaded
and conquered Gaul and Britain, and after
these great military achievements, found that he
could not sheath his sword until he had met in
battle his rival Pompey. C&aelig;sar defeated Pompey
at Pharsalia, in Thessaly (48 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>), and pursued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
him to Egypt. Pompey was murdered in Egypt,
and his last followers finally defeated in Spain, and
in 45 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> Julius C&aelig;sar returned to Rome, and
was declared perpetual <i>imperator</i>. On March 15,
44 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, he was assassinated. It is possible that
the career of this great man may have promoted
the surgery of the battlefield, but his reign as
Emperor was too short, and the political situation
of his time too acute, to permit of much progress
in the arts of peace generally, and in the medical
art particularly. Julius C&aelig;sar bestowed the right
of Roman citizenship on all medical practitioners
in the city.</p>

<p>Referring to the death of Julius C&aelig;sar, Suetonius
writes that among so many wounds there was
none that was mortal, in the opinion of the surgeon
Antistus, except the second, which he received in
the breast.</p>

<p>Octavianus was appointed one of the second
triumvirate, his colleagues being Mark Antony and
Lepidus. Lepidus was first forced out of the
triumvirate, and Octavianus and Mark Antony
then came into conflict. During these rivalries,
a great civic work was accomplished by Marcus
Agrippa, who built the aqueduct known as <i>Aqua
Julia</i>. A landmark in history is the battle of
Actium, in which Octavianus defeated Mark
Antony and his ally Cleopatra, and within a few
years Octavianus was proclaimed Emperor as
Augustus C&aelig;sar (27 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>). Under his rule Rome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
greatly prospered, and we shall now consider the
state of medicine and of sanitation during his
illustrious reign.</p>

<p>In the Roman Empire there was a spirit of
toleration abroad, "and the various modes of
worship which prevailed in the Roman world were
all considered by the people as equally true; by the
philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate,
as equally useful. And thus toleration produced
not only mutual indulgence, but even religious
concord" (Gibbon).</p>

<p>The systems of philosophy in vogue were those
of the Stoics, the Platonists, the Academics, and
the Epicureans, and of these only the Platonists
had any belief in God, who was to them an idea
rather than a Supreme Being. The great aim of
both the wise and the foolish was to glorify their
nationality, and their beliefs, their rites, and their
superstitions, were all for the glory of mighty
Rome.</p>

<p>Educated Romans were able to speak and write
both Latin and Greek, and the latter language was
the vehicle used by men of science and of letters.</p>

<p>The population of the city of Rome at the
beginning of the Augustan age was not less than
half a million of people, and probably exceeded
this number. There was no middle class, a
comparatively small number of gentry, a very
numerous <i>plebs</i> or populace, and many slaves.
The Emperor Augustus boasted that after the war<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with Sextus Pompeius he handed over 30,000
slaves, who had been serving with the enemy,
to their masters to be punished. The slaves
were looked upon by their masters as chattels.
The plebs had the spirit of paupers and, to keep
them contented and pacific, were fed and shown
brutalizing spectacles in the arenas. Augustus
wrote that he gave the people wild-beast hunts
in the circus and amphitheatres twenty-six times,
in which about 3,500 animals were killed. It was
his custom to watch the Circensian games from his
palace in view of a multitude of spectators.</p>

<p>Throughout the country generally agriculture
prospered, and the supply of various grasses for
feeding cattle in the winter increased the multitude
of the flocks and herds; great attention was
given also to mines and fisheries and all forms of
industry. Virgil praised his beautiful and fertile
country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But no, not Medeland with its wealth of woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair Ganges, Hermus thick with golden silt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can match the praise of Italy....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here blooms perpetual spring, and summer here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In months that are not summer's; twice teem the flocks:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice does the tree yield service of her fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark too, her cities, so many and so proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mighty toil the achievement, town on town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up rugged precipices heaved and reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rivers gliding under ancient walls."<a name="FNanchor_V_3" id="FNanchor_V_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The city of Rome was not a desirable place for
medical practice, for the lower classes were degraded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and thriftless, and the relatively small upper classes
were tyrannical, debauched, superstitious, selfish
and cruel. The younger Pliny, who was one of
the best type of Romans, tried to investigate the
purity of the lives of the Christians, and did not
hesitate to put to torture two women, deaconesses,
who belonged to the new religion, but he "could
discover only an obstinate kind of superstition
carried to great excess." His conduct and his
opinion speak eloquently of the nature of a Roman
gentleman of the Empire. As for the state of
the poor under Augustus, 200,000 persons in
Rome received outdoor relief. Although the rich
had every luxury that desire could suggest and
wealth afford, the great need of the common
people was food. The city had to rely mainly on
imported corn, and the price of this at times
became prohibitive owing to scarcity&mdash;sometimes
the result of piracy and the dangers of the sea,
but often caused by artificial means owing to the
merchants "cornering" the supply&mdash;and it was
necessary for the State, through the Emperor, to
intervene to make regulations and to distribute
the grain free or below its market value. It has
been computed that about 50,000 strangers lived
in Rome, many of whom were adventurers.</p>

<p>The imperial city was the happy hunting-ground
of quacks, who gave themselves high-sounding
names and wore gorgeous raiment. They went
about followed by a retinue of pupils and grateful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
patients. In some cases the patients were compelled
to promise, in the event of being cured, that
they would serve their doctor ever afterwards. The
retinue of students, no doubt, was rather disturbing
to a nervous patient, and Martial wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Faint was I only, Symmachus, till thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Backed by an hundred students, throng'dst my bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hundred icy fingers chilled my brow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had no fever; now I'm nearly dead."<a name="FNanchor_V_4" id="FNanchor_V_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides quack doctors there were drug sellers
(<i>pharmacopola</i>), who sold their medicines in booths
or hawked them in the city and the country. In
the time of the Empire the medicines of the
regular practitioners were sold with a label which
specified the name of the drug and of the inventor,
the ingredients, the disease it was to be used for,
and the method of taking it. Drug sellers dispensed
cosmetics as well as medicines, and some
of the itinerant dealers sold poison. The regular
physicians bought medicines already compounded
by the druggists, and the latter, as in our own
day, prescribed as well as the physicians.</p>

<p>Depilatories were much in vogue, and were
usually made of arsenic and unslaked lime, but
also from the roots and juices of plants. They
were first used only by women, but in later times
also by effeminate men. Tweezers have been discovered
which were adapted for pulling out hairs,
and most of the depilatories were recommended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
to be applied after the use of the tweezers. The
duty of pulling out hairs was performed by slaves.</p>

<p>Most of the medical practitioners in the time of
Augustus were either slaves or freedmen. Posts
of responsibility and of honour were sometimes
assigned to freedmen, as is shown by the appointment
by Nero of Helius, a freedman, to the
administration of Rome in the absence of his
imperial master. Cicero wrote letters to his freedman
Tiro in terms of friendship and affection.
The master of a great household selected a slave
for his ability and aptitude, and had him trained
to be the medical adviser of the household; and
the skill shown by the doctor sometimes gained
for him his freedom.</p>

<p>There were 400 slaves in one great household
of Rome, and they were all executed for not having
prevented the murder of their master.<a name="FNanchor_V_5" id="FNanchor_V_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is
recorded that physicians were sometimes compelled
to do the disgusting work of mutilating
slaves.<a name="FNanchor_V_6" id="FNanchor_V_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The price of a slave physician was fixed
at sixty solidi.<a name="FNanchor_V_7" id="FNanchor_V_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The great majority of physicians
in Rome were freedmen who had booths in which
they prescribed and compounded, and they were
aided by freedmen and slaves who were both
assistants and pupils. The medical profession, as
has been shown, never attained the same dignity
as in Greece. It should be understood that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was a class of practising physicians in Rome quite
distinct from the slave doctors. The following
account of Lucius Horatillavus, a Roman quack
of the time of Augustus, is taken from the <i>British
Medical Journal</i> of June 10, 1911, and originated
in an article in the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nouvelle</i>, written by
M. Fernand Mazade:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was a handsome man, and came from
Naples to Rome, his sole outfit being a toga
made of a piece of cloth adorned with obscene
pictures and a small Asiatic mitre. Like many
of his kind at that day, he sold poisons and invented
five or six new remedies which were more
or less haphazard mixtures of wine and poisonous
substances. He had the good luck to cure his
first patient, Titus Cn&oelig;us Leno, who, being a
poet, straightway constituted himself the <i>vates
sacer</i> of his physician, and induced some of his
fashionable mistresses to place themselves under
his hands. So profitable was Horatillavus's
practice that he is said to have saved 150,000
sesterces in a few months. But for a moment his
good fortune seemed to abandon him. A Roman
lady, Sulpicia Pallas, died suddenly under his
ministrations. This may have been due to his
ignorance or carelessness; but he was accused of
having poisoned his patient. This event might
have been expected to bring his career to an end;
but it was not long before he recovered the confidence
of the people whom he deluded with his
mystical language and promises of cure. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
three methods of treatment, all consisting of
baths&mdash;hot, tepid, or cold&mdash;preceded or followed
by the taking of wonder-working medicines.
Horatillavus treated every kind of disease, internal
and external; he even practised midwifery, which
was then in the hands of women. Ten years after
he settled in Rome he had accumulated a fortune
of some 6,000,000 sesterces. He had a villa at
Tusculum, whither he went three times a month;
there he led a luxurious life in the most beautiful
surroundings, and there his evil fate overtook
him. His orchard was his especial pride. One
day he found that birds had played havoc with
his figs, the like of which were not to be found in
Italy. Determined to prevent similar depredations
in future, he poisoned the fig trees. Continuing
his walk, he plucked fruits of various kinds here
and there. While eating the fruit he had culled
and drinking choice wine, he put into his mouth
a poisoned fig, which he had inadvertently
gathered, and quickly died in convulsions. Before
passing away, however, he is said to have composed
his own epitaph. This M. Mazade believes
he has found. It reads: "The manes of Sulpicia
Pallas have avenged her. Here lies Lucius Horatillavus,
physician, who poisoned himself." If the
epitaph is genuine, it is a confession of guilt.
The death of the quack by his own poison is a
curious Nemesis. The manner of his death proves
that it was accidental, as few quacks are bold

<h3>IN THE REIGN OF THE C&AElig;SARS&mdash;TO THE
DEATH OF NERO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Augustus &mdash; His illnesses &mdash; Antonius Musa &mdash; M&aelig;cenas &mdash; Tiberius &mdash; Caligula &mdash; Claudius &mdash; Nero &mdash; Seneca &mdash; Astrology &mdash; Archiater &mdash; Women
poisoners &mdash; Oculists in Rome.</p></div>

<p>Long before the settlement of the constitutional
status of Augustus in 27 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, he had undertaken
many reforms. In 34 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, Agrippa, under
the influence of Augustus, had improved the water
supply of Rome by restoring the Aqua Marcia, and
Augustus had repaired and enlarged the cloac&aelig;,
and repaired the principal streets. Road commissions
were appointed 27 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> The Aqua Virgo
was built 19 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span> Many of the <i>collegia</i>, or guilds,
founded for the promotion of the interests of professions
and trades had been misused for political
purposes, and Augustus deprived many of them
of their charters. <i>Cur&aelig;</i>, or commissions, were
appointed to superintend public works, streets and
the water-supply; and the Tiber was dredged,
cleansed and widened, and its liability to overflow
reduced. No new building could be built more
than 70 ft. high. Augustus also established fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
brigades. It has been said that he found the city
built of brick and left it built of marble.</p>

<p>He revived many old religious customs, such as
the Augury of Public Health, and identified himself
closely with the rites and customs of the
people. He inculcated that sense of duty which
the Romans called <i>pietas</i>, and attempted to
improve the morals of the citizens by the enactment
of sumptuary laws; the philosophers hoped
to do good in the same direction by appealing to
the intellect and reason, a method that was equally
ineffectual. Marriages and an increased birth-rate
were encouraged, and parents were honoured and
given special privileges. The wisdom and prudence
of Augustus were strangely accompanied by
credulity and superstition. He was a profound
believer in omens, and attached great importance
to astrology. His horoscope showed that he was
born under the sign of Capricorn.</p>

<p>He suffered from various illnesses, although in
his younger days he looked handsome and athletic.
He carefully nursed his health against his many
infirmities, avoiding chiefly the free use of the
bath; but he was often rubbed with oil, and
sweated in a stove, after which he was bathed in
tepid water, warmed either by a fire, or by being
exposed to the heat of the sun. When, on
account of his nerves, he was obliged to have
recourse to sea-water, or the waters of Albula, he
was contented with sitting over a wooden tub,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
(which he called by a Spanish name, <i>Dureta</i>), and
plunging his hands and feet in the water by turns.<a name="FNanchor_VI_1" id="FNanchor_VI_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_VI_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
His physician was Antonius Musa, to whom was
erected, by public subscription, a statue near that
of &AElig;sculapius. During an attack of congestion of
the liver when heat failed to give relief, Antonius
Musa advised cold applications for the Emperor,
which had the desired effect. Suetonius, the
historian, wrote that this was "a desperate and
doubtful method of cure." A more desperate and
doubtful method of cure, however, was carried out
by the same physician. He successfully banished
an attack of sciatica that greatly troubled Augustus
by the expedient of beating the affected part with
a stick. Antonius Musa received honours from
Augustus, and the Emperor also exempted all
physicians from the payment of taxes, and from
other public obligations.</p>

<p>In the time of Augustus natural philosophy
made little progress, and Virgil strongly desired its
advancement. Human anatomy, as a study, had
not been introduced, and physiology was almost
unknown. In medicine, the standard of practice
was the writings of Hippocrates, and the Materia
Medica consisted of remedies suggested by the
whimsical notions of their inventors.</p>

<p>Pliny wrote that the water cure was the principal
remedy in his day, as it was indeed throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the Empire, and it was certainly the most popular.
Seneca was very severe on the sentiment of a poem
written by M&aelig;cenas, the friend and counsellor of
Augustus, but it serves to reveal some of the most
dreaded maladies of the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though racked with gout in hand and foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though cancer deep should strike its root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though palsy shake my feeble thighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though hideous lump on shoulder rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From flaccid gum teeth drop away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet all is well if life but stay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Malaria was one of the principal causes <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'o' in place of 'of'.">of</ins>
mortality in and near Rome in the reign of
Augustus C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>Augustus's fatal illness occurred in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 14 from
chronic diarrh&oelig;a, and the Emperor, like the true
Roman that he was, displayed great calmness and
fortitude in his last days.</p>

<p>Tiberius succeeded to the throne in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 14, and
began a career of infamy. How little knowledge
was likely to gain from his patronage is shown by
the fact, recorded by Pliny, that the shop and tools
of the artist who discovered how to make glass
malleable were destroyed. Assassins and perpetrators
of every abomination were the fit companions
of this tyrant.</p>

<p>Thrasyllus, the astrologer, lived with Tiberius,
who was a firm believer in the magic arts. This
reign is made illustrious in the history of medicine
by the work of Celsus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Caligula, who became Emperor in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 34, was
guilty of the most inhuman conduct. Criminals
were given to the wild beasts for their food, and
even people of honourable rank had their faces
branded with hot irons as a punishment by order
of this mad tyrant.</p>

<p>Claudius, the successor of Caligula, completed
some very important public works in his reign,
including great aqueducts and drains, but learning
was at a low ebb in his day. Claudius Etruscus,
the freedman of the Emperor Claudius, erected
baths referred to by Martial. The ruins of the
arches of the Aqua Claudia still remain.</p>

<p>Thrasyllus, a son of the astrologer who lived in
the time of Tiberius, is said to have predicted to
Nero the dignity of the purple. Nero would have
been favourably disposed towards physicians if he
had heeded the advice of his tutor, Seneca, who
wrote: "People pay the doctor for his trouble;
for his kindness they still remain in his debt."
"Great reverence and love is due to both the
teacher and the doctor. We have received from
them priceless benefits; from the doctor, health
and life; from the teacher, the noble culture of the
soul. Both are our friends, and deserve our most
sincere thanks, not so much by their merchantable
art, as by their frank goodwill."<a name="FNanchor_VI_2" id="FNanchor_VI_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_VI_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The practice of
necromancy in the time of Nero had grown to such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
an extent that an edict of banishment was issued
against all magicians, but this did not lessen the
popularity of the magicians, who indeed prospered
under the semblance of persecution, and were
honoured in times of public difficulty and danger.
The practice of astrology came from the Chaldeans,
and was introduced into Greece in the third
century before Christ. It was accepted by all
classes, but specially by the Stoic philosophers.
In 319 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, Cornelius Hispallus banished the
Chaldeans from Rome, and ordered them to leave
Italy within ten days. In 33 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, they were again
banished by Marcus Agrippa, and Augustus also
issued an edict against them. They were punished
sometimes by death, and their calling must have
been lucrative to induce them to continue in spite
of the severe punishments to which they made
themselves liable. The penal laws against them,
however, were in operation only intermittently.
They were consulted by all classes, from the
Emperor downwards.</p>

<p>There were many physicians in the reign of
Nero, but none of great eminence. Andromachus
was physician to the Emperor, and had the title
of <i>archiater</i>, which means "chief of the
physicians."</p>

<p>An account of the archiaters is of interest.
The name was applied to Christ by St. Jerome.
There were two classes of archiaters in time, the
one class called <i>archiatri sancti palati</i>; the other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<i>archiatri populares</i>. The former attended the
Emperor, and were court physicians; the latter
attended the people. Although Nero appointed
the first archiater, the name is not commonly used
in Latin until the time of Constantine, and the
division into two classes probably dates from about
that time. The <i>archiatri sancti palati</i> were
of high rank, and were the judges of disputes
between physicians. The Archiatri had many
privileges conferred upon them. They, and their
wives and children, did not have to pay taxes.
They were not obliged to give lodgings to soldiers
in the provinces, and they could not be put in
prison. These privileges applied more especially
to the higher class. When an <i>archiater sancti
palati</i> ceased attendance on the Emperor he took
the title of ex-archiater. The title <i>comes archiatorum</i>
means "count of the Archiatri," and gave
rank among the high nobility of the Empire.</p>

<p>The <i>archiatri populares</i> attended the sick poor,
and each city had five, seven or ten, according to
its size. Rome had fourteen of these officers,
besides one for the vestal virgins, and one for the
gymnasia. They were paid by the Government
for attending the poor, but were not restricted to
this class of practice, and were well paid by
their prosperous patients. Their office was more
lucrative but not so honourable as that of the
archiaters of the palace. The <i>archiatri populares</i>
were elected by the people themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Suetonius describes the treatment Nero underwent
for the improvement of his voice: "He
would lie upon his back with a sheet of lead upon
his breast, clear his stomach and bowels by vomits
and clysters, and forbear the eating of fruits, or
food prejudicial to his voice." He built, at great
expense, magnificent public baths supplied from
the sea and from hot springs, and was the first to
build a public gymnasium in Rome.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that in the time of Nero
there was a class of women poisoners. Nero
employed one of these women, Locusta by name,
and after she had poisoned Britannicus, rewarded
her with a great estate in land, and placed disciples
with her to be instructed in her nefarious trade.</p>

<p>There was also a very ignorant class of oculists
in Rome in the time of Nero, but at Marseilles
Demosthenes Philalethes was deservedly celebrated,
and his book on diseases of the eye was in use for
several centuries. The eye doctors of Rome
employed ointments almost entirely, and about
two hundred seals have been discovered which had
been attached to pots of eye salves, each seal
bearing the inventor's and proprietor's name.
In the time of Galen, these quack oculists were
very numerous, and Galen inveighs against them.
Martial satirized them: "Now you are a gladiator
who once were an ophthalmist; you did as a
doctor what you do as a gladiator." "The blear-eyed
Hylas would have paid you sixpence, O<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Quintus; one eye is gone, he will still pay threepence;
make haste and take it, brief is your chance;
when he is blind, he will pay you nothing." The
oculists of Alexandria were very proficient, and
some of their followers, at various times throughout
the period of the Roman Empire, were remarkably
skilful. Their literature has perished, but it
is believed that they were able to operate on
cataract.</p>

<p>With the death of Nero in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 68, the direct
line of the C&aelig;sars became extinct.</p>

<h3>PHYSICIANS FROM THE TIME OF AUGUSTUS TO
THE DEATH OF NERO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Celsus &mdash; His life and works &mdash; His influence on Medicine &mdash; Meges
of Sidon &mdash; Apollonius of Tyana &mdash; Alleged miracles &mdash; Vettius
Valleus &mdash; Scribonius Longus &mdash; Andromachus &mdash; Thessalus
of Tralles &mdash; Pliny.</p></div>

<p>Aulus Cornelius Celsus lived in the reigns
of Augustus and Tiberius. References in his works
show that he either lived at the same time as
Themison or shortly after him. Verona has been
claimed as his birthplace, but the purity of his
literary style shows that he lived for a considerable
time in Rome, and he was probably educated there.
In Pliny's account of the history of medicine,
Celsus is not mentioned as having practised in
Rome, and it is almost certain that he combined
the practice of medicine with the study of science
and literary pursuits; his practice was not general,
but restricted to his friends and dependents.
His writings show that he had a clinical knowledge
of disease and a considerable amount of
medical experience. He wrote not only on medicine
but also on history, philosophy, jurisprudence
and rhetoric, agriculture and military tactics.
His great medical work, "De Medicina," comprises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
eight books. He properly begins with
the history of medicine, and then proceeds to
discuss the merits of the controversy between the
Dogmatici and the Empirici. The first two books
deal with general principles and with diet, and the
remaining books with particular diseases; the third
and fourth with internal diseases, the fifth and
sixth with external diseases and pharmacy, and
the last two are surgical, and of great merit and
importance. In his methods of treatment there
can be discerned the influence of Asclepiades of
Prusa, and the Hippocratic principle of aiding
rather than opposing nature, but some of his work
displays originality. His devotion to Hippocrates
hindered very much the exercise of his own powers,
and set a bad example, in this respect, to his
successors.</p>

<p>He was rather free in the use of the lancet, but
not to the same extent as his contemporaries, and
he advocated the use of free purgation as well as
bleeding. He never could rid his mind of the
orthodox humoral theories of his predecessors.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Surgery.</i>&mdash;Although Celsus is the first writer
in Rome to deal fully with surgical procedures, it
must not be inferred that the practice of this art
began to be developed in his time, for surgery was
then much more advanced than medicine. Many
major operations were performed, and it is very
instructive for doctors of the present day to learn
that much that is considered modern was well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
understood by the ancients. There is no greater
fallacy than to suppose that medical practice
generally, and surgery in particular, has reached
no eminence except in very recent times. The
operation of crushing a stone in the bladder was
devised at Alexandria by Ammonius Lithotomos,
(287 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>), and is thus described by Celsus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A hook or crotchet is fixed upon the stone in
such a way as easily to hold it firm, even when
shaken, so that it may not revolve backward; then
an iron instrument is used, of moderate thickness,
thin at the front end but blunt, which, when
applied to the stone and struck at the other end,
cleaves it. Great care must be taken that the
instrument do not come into contact with the
bladder itself, and that nothing fall upon it by the
breaking of the stone."</p>

<p>Celsus describes plastic operations for the repair
of the nose, lips and ears, though these operations
are generally supposed to have been recently
devised.</p>

<p>He describes lithotomy, and operations upon
the eye, as practised at Alexandria, both probably
introduced there from India. Subcutaneous
urethrotomy was also practised in his time.</p>

<p>Trephining had long been a well-known operation
of surgery. There is an account in detail of how
amputation should be performed.</p>

<p>The teaching of Celsus in reference to dislocations
and fractures is remarkably advanced. Dislocations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
he points out, should be reduced before
inflammation sets in, and in failure of union of
fractures, he recommends extension and the rubbing
together of the ends of the broken bone to promote
union. If necessary, after minor measures have
failed to promote union, he recommends an incision
down to the ends of the bones, and the open
incision and the fracture will heal at the same
time.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that Celsus knew of the
danger of giving purgatives in strangulated rupture
of the bowels. For uncomplicated rupture he
recommends reduction by taxis and operation.
Cauterization of the canal is part of the operation.
He also gives careful directions for removing
foreign bodies from the ears.</p>

<p>Celsus writes very fully on h&aelig;morrhage, and
describes the method of tying two ligatures upon
a blood-vessel, and severing it between the
ligatures. His method of amputating in cases
of gangrene by a simple circular incision was in
use down to comparatively modern times. He
describes catheterization, plastic operations on the
face, the resection of ribs for the cure of sinuses in
the chest walls, operation for cataract, ear disease
curable by the use of the syringe, and operations
for goitre. These goitre operations are generally
supposed to be a recent triumph of surgery.</p>

<p>Celsus also had knowledge of dentistry, for he
writes of teeth extraction by means of forceps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the fastening of loose teeth with gold wire, and
a method of bursting decayed and hollow teeth
by means of peppercorns forced into the cavity.
He has described also many of the most difficult
operations in obstetrics.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that Celsus lived centuries
before the introduction of chloroform and
ether, it is wonderful to contemplate what was
accomplished long ago.</p>

<p>The qualities which should distinguish a surgeon
were described by Celsus thus: "He should not be
old, his hand should be firm and steady, and he
should be able to use his left hand equally with
his right; his sight should be clear, and his mind
calm and courageous, so that he need not hurry
during an operation and cut less than required,
as if the screams of the patient made no impression
upon him."</p>

<p>(2) <i>Anatomy.</i>&mdash;Celsus understood fairly well the
situation of the internal organs, and knew well
the anatomy of the chest and female pelvis. His
knowledge of the skeleton was particularly complete
and accurate. He describes very fully the
bones of the head, including the perforated plate
of the ethmoid bone, the sutures, the teeth,
and the skeletal bones generally. Portal states
that Celsus knew of the semicircular canals. He
understood the structure of the joints, and points
out that cartilage is part of their formation.</p>

<p>Celsus wrote: "It is both cruel and superfluous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to dissect the bodies of the living, but to dissect
those of the dead is necessary for learners, for
they ought to know the position and order which
dead bodies show better than a living and wounded
man. But even the other things which can only
be observed in the living, practice itself will show
in the cures of the wounded, a little more slowly
but somewhat more tenderly."</p>

<p>(3) <i>Medicine.</i>&mdash;His treatment of fevers was excellent,
for he recognized that fever was an effort
of Nature to throw off morbid materials. His
recipes are not so complicated, but more sensible
and effective than those of his immediate
successors. He understood the use of enemas
and artificial feeding. In cases of insanity he
recognized that improvement followed the use of
narcotics in the treatment of the accompanying
insomnia. He recognized also morbid illusions.
He recommended lotions and salves for the treatment
of some eye diseases.</p>

<p>Although Celsus practised phlebotomy, he discountenanced
very strongly its excessive use. The
physicians in Rome, in his time, carried bleeding
to great extremes. "It is not," wrote Celsus, "a
new thing to let blood from the veins, but it is
new that there is scarcely a malady in which blood
is not drawn. Formerly they bled young men,
and women who were not pregnant, but it had
not been seen till our days that children, pregnant
women, and old men were bled." The reason for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
bleeding the strong and plethoric was to afford
outlet to an excessive supply of blood, and the
weak and an&aelig;mic were similarly treated to get
rid of evil humours, so that hardly any sick person
could escape this drastic treatment.</p>

<p>Emetics were greatly used in the time of Celsus.
Voluptuaries made use of them to excite an
appetite for food, and they used them after eating
heavy meals to prepare the stomach for a second
bout of gluttony. Many gourmands took an
emetic daily. Celsus said that emetics should
not be used as a frequent practice if the attainment
of old age was desired.</p>

<p>Celsus excelled as a compiler, and had the
faculty of selecting the most admirable contributions
to the art of healing from previous medical
writers. His writings also give an account of
what was best in the medical practice of Rome
about his own time. He had a great love for
learning, and it is remarkable that he was attracted
to the study of medicine, for he was a patrician,
and members of his class considered study of that
kind beneath the dignity of their rank.</p>

<p>In the Augustan age, when literature in Rome
reached its highest level, the literary style of
Celsus was fit to be classed with that of the
great writers of his time. He was never quoted
as a great authority on medicine or surgery by
later medical writers; and Pliny refers to him as
a literary man, and not as a practising physician.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
From the fact that he elaborated no new system,
and founded no new medical sect, it is not strange
that he had no disciples.</p>

<p>In later centuries his works were used as a
textbook for students, not only for the information
they supplied, but also because of their
excellence as literature.</p>

<p>Parts of the foregoing synopsis of the writings
of Celsus are drawn from the writings of
Hermann Baas and of Berdoe.</p>

<p><i>Meges of Sidon</i> (20 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>) was a famous surgeon
who practised in Rome shortly before the time of
Celsus. He was regarded by Celsus as the most
skilful surgeon of that period, and his works, of
which nothing now remains, were quoted by
Celsus, and also referred to by Pliny. Meges was
a follower of Themison. He is said to have
invented instruments used in cutting for stone,
and he wrote on tumours of the breast and dislocation
of the knee. There have been several
famous doctors called <i>Eudemus</i>. One of these was
an anatomist in the third century before Christ,
and a contemporary, according to Galen, of Herophilus
and Erasistratus. He gave great attention
to the anatomy and physiology of the nervous
system. There was, however, another Eudemus,
a physician of Rome, who became entangled in an
intrigue with the wife of the son of the Emperor
Tiberius. He aided her in an attempt to poison
her husband in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 23. He was put to torture,
and finally executed by order of Tiberius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Apollonius of Tyana</i> was born four years before
the Christian era, in the time of Augustus C&aelig;sar,
and is known chiefly for the parallel that has been
drawn by ancient and modern writers between his
supposed miracles and those of the Saviour. His
doings as described by Philostratus are extraordinary
and incredible, and he was put forward by
the Eclectics in opposition to the unique powers
claimed by Christ and believed in by His followers.
Apollonius is said to have studied the philosophy
of the Platonic, Sceptic, Epicurean, Peripatetic
and Pythagorean schools, and to have adopted
that of Pythagoras. He schooled himself in early
manhood in the asceticism of that philosophy. He
abstained from animal food and strong drink, wore
white linen garments and sandals made of bark,
and let his hair grow long. For five years he
preserved a mystic silence, and during this period
the truths of philosophy became known to him.
He had interviews with the Magi in Asia Minor,
and learned strange secrets from the Brahmans in
India. In Greece he visited the temples and
oracles, and exercised his powers of healing. Like
Pythagoras, he travelled far and wide, disputing
about philosophy wherever he went, and he gained
an extraordinary reputation for magical powers.
The priests of the temples gave him divine honours
and sent the sick to him to be cured. He arrived
in Rome just after an edict had been promulgated
by Nero against magicians. He was tried before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Telesinus, the consul, and Tigellinus, the base
favourite of the Emperor. He was acquitted by
Telesinus because of his love of philosophy, and
by Tigellinus because of his fear of magic. Subsequently,
at Alexandria, Apollonius, in virtue of
his magic power, affirmed that he would make
Vespasian emperor, and afterwards became the
friend of Titus, Vespasian's son. On the accession
of Domitian, Apollonius stirred up the provinces
against him, and was ordered to be brought in
custody to Rome, but he surrendered himself to the
authorities, and was brought into the presence of
the Emperor to be questioned. He began to praise
Nerva, and was immediately ordered to prison and
to chains. It is said that he miraculously escaped,
and spent the remainder of his days in Ephesus.</p>

<p>The relation of Apollonius to the art of medicine
is connected with his visits, on his travels, to the
temples of &AElig;sculapius, and his healing of the sick
and alleged triumph over the laws of Nature. He
was also credited with raising the dead, casting
out devils and other miracle-working that appears
to have been borrowed from the life of Christ. No
doubt he was a genuine philosopher and follower of
Pythagoras. His history is, on the whole, worthy
of belief, except the part relating to miracles. It
is noteworthy that he did not claim for himself
miraculous power. Newman in his "Life of
Apollonius" takes the view that the account of the
miracles of Apollonius is derived from the narrative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of Christ's miracles, and has been concocted by
people anxious to degrade the character of the
Saviour. The attempt to make him appear as a
pagan Christ has been renewed in recent years.</p>

<p>In the realm of medical practice he succeeded
by imposture probably, but also in a genuine way
by means of suggestion, and no doubt he had also
acquired medical knowledge from study and travelling
among people who had healing powers and
items of medical knowledge perhaps unknown at
the present day.</p>

<p><i>Vettius (or Vectius) Valleus</i>, was of equestrian
rank but he did not confer any honour on the
medical profession. He was one of the lewd companions
of Messalina, the wife of the Emperor
Claudius, and was put to death in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 48. He
was a believer in Themison's doctrines, and is said
by Pliny<a name="FNanchor_VII_1" id="FNanchor_VII_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_VII_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to have founded a new medical sect, but
nearly all the Methodici attempted to create a new
sect by adding to, or subtracting a little from, the
tenets of Methodism.</p>

<p><i>Scribonius Largus</i> (about <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 45) was physician
to Claudius and accompanied him to Britain. He
wrote several medical books, and is reputed to have
used electricity for the relief of headaches.</p>

<p><i>Andromachus</i>, the elder, was physician to Nero,
and the first archiater. He was born in Crete.
He was the inventor of a compound medicine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
called after himself, "Theriaca Andromachi." He
gave directions for making it in a poem of 174
lines. This poem is quoted by Galen, who explains
that Andromachus gave his instructions a poetical
form to assist memory, and to prevent the likelihood
of alteration.</p>

<p><i>Andromachus</i>, the younger, was the son of the
first archiater, and was, like his father, physician
to Nero. He wrote a book on Pharmacy, in three
volumes.</p>

<p><i>Thessalus of Tralles</i>, in Lydia, lived in Rome in
the reign of Nero, and dedicated one of his books
to the Emperor. He was a charlatan with no
medical knowledge, but with a good deal of ability
and assurance. He said that medicine surpassed
all other arts, and he surpassed all other physicians.
His father had been a weaver, and in his youth
Thessalus followed the same calling, and never had
any medical training. This did not prevent him,
however, from acquiring a great reputation as a
doctor, and making a fortune from medical practice.
At first, he associated himself with the
views of the Methodici, but afterwards amended
them as he thought fit, until he had convinced the
public, and perhaps also himself, that he was the
founder of a new and true system of medicine.
He spoke in very disrespectful and violent terms
of his predecessors, and said that no man before
him had done anything to advance the science of
medicine. Besides having an endowment of natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
shrewdness and ability, he was equipped with great
powers of self-advertisement, and could cajole the
rich and influential. He was an adept in the art
of flattery. Galen often refers to him, and always
with contempt. Thessalus was able, so he said,
to teach the medical art in six months, and he
surrounded himself with a retinue of artisans,
weavers, cooks, butchers, and so on, who were
allowed to kill or cure his patients. Sprengel
states that, after the time of Thessalus, the doctors
of Rome forbore to take their pupils with them
on professional visits.</p>

<p>He began a method of treatment for chronic
and obstinate cases. The first three days of the
treatment were given up to the use of vegetable
drugs, emetics, and strict dietary. Then followed
fasting, and finally a course of tonics and restoratives.
He is said to have used colchicum for gout.
The tomb of Thessalus on the Appian Way was
to be seen in Pliny's time. It bore the arrogant
device "Conqueror of Physicians." The success
of Thessalus seems a proof of the cynical belief
that the public take a man's worth at his own
estimate.</p>

<p>Pliny, the elder, lived from <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 23 to 79,
dying during the eruption of Vesuvius when
Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed. He
was not a scientific man, but was a prodigious
recorder of information on all subjects.
Much of this information is inaccurate, for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was not able to discriminate between the true
and the false, or to assign to facts their relative
value.</p>

<p>His great book on Natural History includes
many subjects that cannot properly be considered
as belonging to Natural History. It consists of
thirty-six books and an index, and the author
stated that the work dealt with twenty thousand
important matters, and was compiled from two
thousand volumes.</p>

<p>Although Pliny was not a physician he writes
about medicine, and paints a picture of the state
of medical knowledge of his time. His own
opinions on the subject are of no value. He
believed that magic is a branch of medicine, and
was optimistic enough to hold that there is a
score of remedies for every disease. His writings
upon the virtues of medicines derived from the
human body, from fish, and from plants are more
picturesque than accurate.</p>

<h3>THE FIRST AND SECOND CENTURIES OF THE
CHRISTIAN ERA.</h3>

Rome &mdash; Ancient surgical instruments &mdash; Herodotus &mdash; Heliodorus &mdash; C&aelig;lius
Aurelianus &mdash; Soranus &mdash; Rufus of
Ephesus &mdash; Marinus &mdash; Quintus.</p></div>

<p><i>Athen&aelig;us</i>, of Cilicia, a Stoic and Peripatetic,
founded in Rome the sect of the <i>Pneumatists</i>
about the year <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 69. It was inspired by the
philosophy of Plato. The pneuma, or spirit, was
in their opinion the cause of health and of disease.
They believed that dilatation of the arteries drives
onward the pneuma, and contraction of the
arteries drives it in a contrary direction. The
pneuma passes from the heart to the arteries.
Their theories also had reference to the elements.
Thus, the union of heat and moisture maintains
health; heat and dryness cause acute diseases;
cold and moisture cause chronic diseases; cold
and dryness cause mental depression, and at death
there are both dryness and coldness. In spite of
these strange opinions the Pneumatists made
some scientific progress, and recognized some
diseases hitherto unknown. Galen wrote of the
Pneumatists: "They would rather betray their
country than abjure their opinions." The founder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of the sect of Pneumatists was a very prolific writer,
for the twenty-ninth volume of one of his works is
quoted by Oribasius. The teaching of the Pneumatists
speedily gave way to that of the <i>Eclectics</i>,
of whom Galen was by far the most celebrated.
They tried to reconcile the teaching of the Dogmatists,
Methodists, and Empirics, and adopted
what they considered to be the best teaching of
each sect. The Eclectics were very similar to, if
not identical with, the <i>Episynthetics</i>, founded by a
pupil of Athen&aelig;us, by name, <i>Agathinus</i>. He was
a Spartan by birth. He is frequently quoted by
Galen, but none of his writings are extant.</p>

<p><i>Aret&aelig;us, the Cappadocian</i>, practised in Rome
in the first century of our era, in the reign of Nero
or Vespasian. He published a book on medicine,
still extant, which displays a great knowledge of
the symptoms of disease very accurately described,
and reliable for purposes of diagnosis. He was the
first to reveal the glandular nature of the kidneys,
and for the first time employed cantharides as a
counter-irritant (Portal, vol. i, p. 62). It is not
surprising that Aret&aelig;us followed rather closely the
teaching of Hippocrates, but he considered it right
to check some of "the natural actions" of the
body, which Hippocrates thought were necessary
for the restoration of health. He was not against
phlebotomy, and used strong purgatives and also
narcotics. He was less tied to the opinions of any
sect than the physicians of his time, and was both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
wonderfully accurate in his opinions and reliable in
treatment. Aret&aelig;us condemned the operation of
tracheotomy first proposed by Asclepiades, and held
"that the heat of the inflammation becomes greater
from the wound and contributes to the suffocation,
and the patient coughs; and even if he escapes this
danger, the lips of the wound do not unite, for both
are cartilaginous and unable to grow together." He
believed, also, that elephantiasis was contagious.
The writings of Aret&aelig;us consist of eight books, and
there have been many editions in various languages.
Only a few chapters are missing.</p>

<p><i>Archigenes</i> was a pupil of Agathinus, and is
mentioned by Juvenal. He was born in Syria and
practised in Rome in the reign of Trajan, <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 98-117.
He introduced new and very obscure terms into his
writings. He wrote on the pulse, and on this Galen
wrote a commentary. He also proposed a classification
of fevers, but his views on this subject were
speculative theories, and not based upon practical
experience and observation. To him is due the
credit of suggesting opium for the treatment of
dysentery, and he also described accurately the
symptoms and progress of abscess of the liver. By
some authorities he is thought to have belonged to
the sect of the Pneumatici.</p>

<p><i>Dioscorides</i> was the author of a famous treatise
on Materia Medica. At different times there were
several physicians of this name. He lived shortly
after Pliny in the first century, but there is some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
doubt as to the exact time. His five books were
the standard work on Materia Medica for many
centuries after his death. He compiled an account
of all the materials in use medicinally, and gave a
description of their properties and action. This
entailed great knowledge and industry, and is of
value as showing what drugs were used in his time.
Since then practically the whole of Materia Medica
has been changed. He held largely to the orthodox
beliefs of Dogmatism, but a great deal of what he
recommends is not comprised in the doctrines of
this sect, and is decidedly Empirical. It is difficult
or impossible to identify many of the drugs referred
to by Dioscorides, partly because his descriptions
are brief, partly because the mistakes of his
predecessors are found in his book.</p>

<p>He exercised as much authority in Materia Medica
as Galen did in the practice of medicine, and the
successors of each were content, in the main, to
follow blindly. A large work was published in
England in 1806 to illustrate the plants of Greece
described in the treatises of Dioscorides.</p>

<p><i>Cassius Felix</i> is supposed to have lived in the
first century of our era, but practically nothing is
known of his history. He wrote a book on medicine
consisting of eighty-four questions on medical and
physical subjects and the answers to them.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 79, after the eruption of Vesuvius, there
was a great pestilence in Rome, which historians
ascribed to the pollution of the air by the eruption.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Fugitives crowded into Rome from the devastated
part of the country, and there was great poverty
and an accumulation of filth in the city, which
was, doubtless, the true cause of the pestilence.
Treatment of fever at that time was very imperfect
at the best, and proper means of prevention and
treatment were entirely absent in time of pestilence.
It has been computed that ten thousand people
died daily at that time in Rome and the surrounding
district. Excavations at Pompeii have done a
great deal to reveal the state of surgical knowledge
towards the end of the first century of our era.
Professor Vulpes has written an account of the
surgical instruments recovered from the ruins, and
there is a collection of ancient surgical instruments
in the Naples museum. Vaginal and rectal specula
have been found: also a forceps for removing
fractured pieces of bone from the surface of the
brain. There is an instrument considered by
Professor Vulpes to have been used as an artery
forceps. Other instruments discovered are:
Forceps for removing tumours; instruments for
tapping in cases of dropsy (such an instrument
was described by Celsus); seven varieties of
probes; bronze catheters; 89 specimens of pincers;
various kinds of knives, bone-elevators, lancets,
spatulas, cauteries, saws, and trephines.<a name="FNanchor_VIII_1" id="FNanchor_VIII_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_VIII_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>There were several physicians and surgeons of
the name of <i>Herodotus</i>. A famous surgeon of that
name lived in Rome about <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 100. He was a
pupil of Athen&aelig;us, and is quoted by Galen and
Oribasius. This Herodotus, according to Baas,
was the discoverer of pomegranate root as a remedy
for tapeworm.</p>

<p><i>Heliodorus</i> was a famous surgeon of Rome, and
lived about the same time as Herodotus. He was
the contemporary of Juvenal. He performed
internal urethrotomy, and wrote on amputations,
injuries of the head, and hernia.</p>

<p><i>C&aelig;lius Aurelianus</i> probably lived in the first
century of the Christian era, but some writers
believe that he was a contemporary of Galen and
a rival, because the one never mentions nor is
mentioned by the other; but this view is unnecessarily
severe upon the standard of medical ethics
attained by the leaders of the profession in early
times. From the style of his writings, it has been
deduced that C&aelig;lius Aurelianus was not a native
of Greece or of Rome. He belonged strictly to
the sect of the Methodici, and his writings are
important as revealing very fully the teaching of
this sect. He mentions some diseases not previously
described, and had a good knowledge of
symptoms. He divided diseases into two classes,
acute and chronic, or, more in conformity with the
terminology of the Methodici, those of constriction
and those of relaxation. Aurelianus did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
concern himself with inquiring into the causation
of diseases. His method was to find out the class
to which a disease belonged, and to treat it
accordingly. He was very practical in his views,
and did a great deal to place treatment upon a
satisfactory basis. His chief weakness was his
failure to recognize the various differences and
gradations, and he attached far too much importance
to the two classes recognized by his school.
He withheld active treatment until he had ascertained
to his own satisfaction the class to which
the disease belonged. C&aelig;lius Aurelianus wrote
three books on acute diseases and five on chronic
diseases. He cites the case of a patient who was
cured of dropsy by tapping, and of a person who
was shot through the lungs with an arrow and
recovered. He agreed with Aret&aelig;us in condemning
tracheotomy. His books are not written in a
good literary style.</p>

<p><i>Soranus</i>, of Ephesus, was an eminent physician
of the Methodist school, who practised in Rome
in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. He wrote
a great work on diseases of women, of which a
Greek manuscript, copied in the fifteenth century,
was discovered in La Biblioth&egrave;que Royale in Paris
by Dietz, who was commissioned by the Prussian
Government to explore the public libraries of
Europe. The same investigator also discovered
another copy of the work, in a worse state of preservation
however, in the Vatican library. Parts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of the writings of Soranus are preserved in the
writings of Oribasius. There is no doubt that
Soranus was a very accomplished obstetrician and
gyn&aelig;cologist. His description of the uterus and
its ligaments and the displacements to which the
organ is liable reveals a practical knowledge of
anatomy. Unlike most medical writers of ancient
times, he did not adopt the method of recording
various methods of treatment copied from previous
writers, but his textbook is systematic. In
writing about a disease he begins with a historical
introduction, and proceeds to describe its causation,
symptoms, and course, and the treatment of its
various phases. His account of obstetrics shows
that the art was well understood in his time. His
work on the subjects of dystocia, inflammation of
the uterus, and prolapse is perhaps the best. He
refers also to hysterectomy. It is interesting to
note that he used the speculum. He describes the
qualifications of a good midwife. She need not
know very much anatomy, but should have been
trained in dietetics, materia medica, and minor
surgical manipulations, such as version. She should
be free from all corrupt and criminal practices,
temperate, and not superstitious or avaricious.</p>

<p>In dealing with the subject of inversion of the
uterus, Soranus points out that this condition may
be caused by traction on the cord. It is noteworthy
that he recognized the method of embryotomy
as necessary when other measures had failed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>In his time leprosy was very prevalent. It had
probably been brought in the first place from the
East into Italy by Pompey. Some of the remedies
used by Soranus for this disease are to be found in
the works of Galen. Soranus wrote books on
other medical subjects, but there is difficulty in
deciding as to what is spurious and what is genuine
in the works attributed to his authorship. There
were other physicians of the same name. Galen
quotes a book by Soranus on pharmacy, and
C&aelig;lius Aurelianus one on fevers. He is also
quoted by Tertullian, and by Paulus &AElig;gineta, who
writes that Soranus was one of the first Greek
physicians to describe the guinea-worm. Soranus,
in the opinion of St. Augustine, was <i>Medicin&aelig;
auctor nobilissimus</i>. He was far removed from
the prejudices and superstitions of his time, as is
shown by his denunciation of magical incantations.</p>

<p><i>Rufus</i>, of Ephesus, also lived in the reign of
Trajan (<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 98-117). His books reveal the state
of anatomical knowledge at Alexandria before the
time of Galen. The recurrent nerves were then
recently discovered. He considered the spleen a
useless organ. He understood that pressure on
the nerves and not on the carotid arteries causes
loss of voice, and that the nerves proceed from
the brain, and are sensory and motor. The heart,
he considered, was the seat of life, and he observed
that its left ventricle is smaller and thicker than
the right. The method of checking bleeding from
blood-vessels by torsion was known to him. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
demonstrated the investing membrane of the
crystalline lens of the eye.<a name="FNanchor_VIII_2" id="FNanchor_VIII_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_VIII_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He wrote also a
treatise in thirty-seven chapters on gout. Many
of the works of Rufus are lost, but fragments
are preserved in other medical writings.</p>

<p><i>Marinus</i> was an anatomist and physician who
lived in the first and second centuries after Christ.
Quintus was one of his pupils.</p>

<p>Marinus wrote twenty volumes on anatomy, of
which Galen gives an abridgment and analysis.
Galen says that Marinus was one of the restorers
of anatomical science. Marinus investigated the
glands and compared them to sponges, and he
imagined that their function was to moisten
and lubricate the surrounding structures. He discovered
the glands of the intestines. He also wrote
a commentary on the aphorisms of Hippocrates.
It is uncertain if he is the Postumius Marinus
who was physician to the younger Pliny.</p>

<p><i>Quintus</i> was renowned in Rome in the first half
of the second century after Christ. Like Galen he
suffered from the jealousy and persecution of his
professional rivals, who trumped up a charge against
him of killing his patients, and he had to flee from
the city. He was known as an expert anatomist,
but published no medical writings. It has been
stated by some of the writers on the history of
medicine that Quintus was the tutor of Galen, but
this statement is lacking in definite proof.</p>

<h3>GALEN.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">His life and works &mdash; His influence on Medicine.</p></div>

<p><i>Claudius Galenus</i>, commonly known as Galen,
has influenced the progress of medical science
by his writings probably more than any other
medical writer. His influence was paramount for
fourteen centuries, and although he made some
original contributions, his works are noteworthy
mainly as an encyclop&aelig;dia of the medical knowledge
of his time and as a review of the work of his
predecessors. There is a great deal of information
in his books about his own life. He was born at
Pergamos in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 130 in the reign of Hadrian.
His father was a scholar and his mother somewhat
of a shrew. Galen, in his boyhood, learned much
from his father's example and instruction, and
at the age of 15 was taught by philosophers of
the Stoic, Platonist, Peripatetic, and Epicurean
schools. He became initiated, writes Dr. Moore,
into "the idealism of Plato, the realism of Aristotle,
the scepticism of the Epicureans, and the
materialism of the Stoics." At the age of 17 he
was destined for the profession of medicine by his
father in consequence of a dream. He studied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
under the most eminent men of his day. He went
to Smyrna to be a pupil of Pelops, the physician,
and Albinus the platonist; to Corinth to study
under Numesianus; to Alexandria for the lectures
of Heraclianus; and to Cilicia, Ph&oelig;nicia, Palestine,
Crete, and Cyprus. At the age of 29 Galen
returned from Alexandria to Pergamos (<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 158),
and was appointed doctor to the School of
Gladiators, and gained much distinction.</p>

<p>He went to Rome for the first time in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 163-4,
and remained for four years; and during this
period he wrote on anatomy and on the teaching
of Hippocrates and Plato. He acquired great fame
as a practitioner and, if he had so desired, might
have attended the Emperor; but it is probable
that Galen thought that the office of physician
to the Emperor might prevent him from leaving
Rome if he wished to do so. He also gave public
lectures and disputations, and was called not only
the "wonder-speaker" but the "wonder-worker."
His success gave rise to envy, and he was afraid
of being poisoned by his less successful rivals.
The reason why he left Rome is not certain, and
the possible causes of his departure are discussed
by Dr. Greenhill in the "Dictionary of Greek and
Roman Biography and Mythology." A pestilence
raged in Rome at this time, but it is unlikely that
Galen would have deserted his patients for that
reason. Probably he disliked Rome, and longed for
his native place. He had been in Pergamos only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
very short time when he was summoned to attend
the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and L. Verus in
Venetia. The latter died of apoplexy on his way
home to Rome, and Galen followed Marcus
Aurelius to the capital. The Emperor soon thereafter
set out to prosecute the war on the Danube,
and Galen was allowed to remain in Rome, as he
had stated that such was the will of &AElig;sculapius.
The Emperor's son Commodus was placed under
the care of Galen during the father's absence, and
at this time also (<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 170) Galen prepared the
famous medicine <i>theriaca</i> for Marcus Aurelius,
who took a small quantity daily. The Emperor
Septimius Severus employed the same physician
and the same medicine about thirty years afterwards.
It is recorded that the philosopher
Eudemius was successfully treated by Galen for
a severe illness caused by an overdose of theriaca,
and that the treatment employed was the same
drug in small doses.</p>

<p>Galen stayed several years in Rome, and wrote
and practised as on his former visit. He again
returned to Pergamos, and probably was in Rome
again at the end of the second century. It is
certain he was still alive in the year 199, and
probably lived in the reign of the Emperor
Caracalla.</p>

<p>He was not only a great physician, but a man
of wide culture in every way. In matters of religion
he was a Monotheist. There was persecution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the Christians in his day, and it is likely
that he came little into contact with the disciples
of the new religion, and heard distorted accounts
of it, but in one of his lost books, quoted by his
Arabian biographers, Galen praises highly the love
of virtue of the Christians.</p>

<p>He no doubt found the practice of medicine
lucrative when he had gained pre-eminence, and
it is recorded that he received &pound;350 for curing the
wife of Boetius, the Consul.</p>

<p>Galen wrote no less than five hundred treatises,
large and small, mostly on medical subjects, but
also on ethics, logic, and grammar. His style is
good but rather diffuse, and he delights in quoting
the ancient Greek philosophers. Before his time,
as we have seen, there were disputes between the
various medical sects. The disciples of Dogmatism
and of Empiricism had been opposed to each other
for several centuries, and the Eclectics, Pneumatists,
and Episynthetics had arisen shortly before
his time. Galen wrote against slavish attachment
to any sect, but "in his general principles
he may be considered as belonging to the Dogmatic
sect, for his method was to reduce all his knowledge,
as acquired by the observation of facts, to
general theoretical principles. These principles
he, indeed, professed to deduce from experience and
observation, and we have abundant proofs of his
diligence in collecting experience, and his accuracy
in making observations; but still in a certain sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
at least, he regards individual facts and the details
of experience as of little value, unconnected with
the principles which he had laid down as the basis
of all medical reasoning. In this fundamental
point, therefore, the method pursued by Galen
appears to have been directly the reverse of that
which we now consider as the correct method of
scientific investigation; and yet, such is the force
of natural genius, that in most instances he
attained the ultimate object in view, although by
an indirect path. He was an admirer of Hippocrates,
and always speaks of him with the most
profound respect, professing to act upon his principles,
and to do little more than expound his
doctrines, and support them by new facts and
observations. Yet, in reality, we have few writers
whose works, both as to substance and manner,
are more different from each other than those of
Hippocrates and Galen, the simplicity of the
former being strongly contrasted with the abstruseness
and refinement of the latter."<a name="FNanchor_IX_1" id="FNanchor_IX_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_IX_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A list of the various editions of Galen's works is
given in Dr. Smith's "Dictionary of Greek and
Roman Biography and Mythology" (1890 edition,
vol. ii, pp. 210-12), and also the titles of the
treatises classified according to the branch of
medical science with which they deal, and it is
convenient to follow this classification.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">I.&mdash;Works on Anatomy and Physiology.</span></h4>

<p>Galen insisted upon the study of anatomy as
essential, and in this respect was in conflict with
the view held by the Methodists and the Empirics
who believed that a physician could understand
diseases without any knowledge of the exact
structure of the body. His books on anatomy
were originally fifteen in number. The last six of
these are now extant only in an Arabic translation,
two copies of which are preserved in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford.</p>

<p>The directions he gives for dissection show that
he was a master of the art. In dissecting out the
portal vein and its ramifications, for instance, he
advises that a probe should be inserted into the
vein, and the point of the probe gradually advanced
as the surrounding tissue is cut away, so that
finally the minute branches are exposed; and he
describes the use of the blowpipe, and other instruments
used in dissection. He carried out the
experiment of tying the iliac and axillary arteries
in animals, and found that this procedure stopped
the pulse in the leg and arm, but caused no serious
symptoms, and he found that even the carotid
arteries could be tied without causing death. He
also pointed out that tying the carotid artery did
not cause loss of voice, but that tying the artery
carelessly so as to include the nerve had this effect.
He was the first to describe the ductus arteriosus,
and the three coats of the arteries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>It is highly improbable that Galen dissected
human bodies in Rome, though he dissected a
great variety of the lower animals. He writes that
the doctors who attended Marcus Aurelius in the
German wars dissected the dead bodies of the barbarians.
The chief mistakes made by Galen as
an anatomist were due to his assumption that
what is true of the anatomy of a lower animal
is true also when applied to man.</p>

<p>Galen greatly assisted the advance of physiology
by recognizing that every part of the body exists
for the purpose of performing a definite function.
Aristotle, like Plato, had taught that "Nature
makes nothing in vain," and Galen's philosophy
was greatly influenced by the teaching of Aristotle.
Galen regarded his work as "a religious hymn in
honour of the Creator, who has given proof of
His Omnipotence in creating everything perfectly
conformable to its destination."</p>

<p>He regarded the structure of various parts,
such as the hand and the membranes of the brain,
as absolute perfection, although his idea of the
human hand was derived from a study of the
ape's, and he had no knowledge of the arachnoid
membrane of the brain, but it would be unfair
to criticize his conclusions because of his failure
to recognize a few comparatively unimportant
details. He discovered the function of the motor
nerves by cutting them experimentally, and so
producing paralysis of the muscles; the platysma,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
interossei, and popliteus muscles were first described
by him. He was the greatest authority on the
pulse, and he recognized that it consisted of a
diastole (expansion) and a systole (contraction) with
an interval after the diastole, and another after the
systole. Aristotle thought that arteries contained
air, but Galen taught that they contained blood,
for, when an artery was wounded, blood gushed
out. He was not far from the discovery of the
circulation. He described the heart as having the
appearance of a muscle, and considered it the source
of natural heat, and the seat of violent passions.
He knew well the anatomy of the human skeleton,
and advised students to go to Alexandria where
they might see and handle and properly study the
bones. He recognized that inspiration is associated
with enlargement of the chest, and imagined that
air passed inside the skull through the cribriform
plate of the ethmoid bone, and passed out by the
same channel, carrying off humours from the brain
into the nose. But some of this air remained and
combined with the vital spirits in the anterior
ventricles of the brain, and finally exuded from the
fourth ventricle, the residence of the soul. Aristotle
had taught that the heart was the seat of the soul,
and the brain relatively unimportant.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">II.&mdash;Works on Dietetics and Hygiene</span>.</h4>

<p>Galen was a strong advocate of exercises and
gymnastics, and eulogizes hunting specially. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
recommends cold baths for people in the prime of
life. As old age is "cold and dry," this is to be
treated with hot baths and the drinking of wine.
He thought that wine was particularly suitable for
the aged, and that old people required three meals
a day, others two meals. He had a very high
opinion of pork as an article of diet, and said
that the strength of athletes could not be maintained
without this form of food.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">III.&mdash;On Pathology</span>.</h4>

<p>Galen believed in the doctrine of the four
elements, and his speculations led him into a belief
in a further subdivision. "Fire is hot and dry;
air is hot and moist; for the air is like a vapour;
water is cold and moist, and earth is cold and dry."
He held that there were three principles in man&mdash;spirits,
solids, and humours&mdash;and eight temperaments
ranging between health and disease and
compatible with life. He retained a good deal of
the teaching of the Pneumatic school, and believed
that the <i>pneuma</i> was different from the soul, but
the vehicle for the interaction of soul and body.
From his theory of the action of the air through the
nose on the contents of the ventricles of the brain
is explained his use of sternutatories, and his belief
in the efficacy of sneezing. Galen's classification
of inflammations shows that his pathology was
not nearly so accurate as his anatomy and
physiology. He described (<i>a</i>) simple inflammation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
caused by excess of blood alone; (<i>b</i>) inflammation
the result of excess of both pneuma and blood;
(<i>c</i>) erysipelatous inflammation when yellow bile
gains admission, and (<i>d</i>) scirrhous or cancerous
when phlegm is present. He did good service by
dividing the causes of disease into remote and
proximate, the former subdivided into two classes&mdash;predisposing
and exciting.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">IV.&mdash;On Diagnosis.</span></h4>

<p>He relied greatly on the doctrine of "critical
days," which were thought to be influenced to some
extent by the moon. His studies of the pulse
were very useful to him in diagnosis. No doubt,
he was an expert diagnostician mainly owing to his
long, varied, and costly medical education, and his
great natural powers of judgment. He asserted
that with the help of the Deity he had never been
wrong, but even his most ardent admirers would
not be wanting in enthusiasm if they amended
"never" into "hardly ever."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">V.&mdash;On Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and
Therapeutics.</span></h4>

<p>In these subjects Galen was not as proficient as
Dioscorides, whose teaching he adopted with that
of other medical authors. In Galen's works there
are lengthy lists of compound medicines, several
medicines being recommended for the same disease,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
and never with very marked confidence. He paid
high prices for various nostrums, and, sad to
relate, placed great faith in amulets, belief in which
was general in his time, and nowhere held more
strongly than in superstitious Rome. Medicines
were classified by him according to their qualities,
by which he meant, not their therapeutic effects,
but their inherent dryness or moistness, coldness
or heat. A medicine might be cold in the first
degree, and not in the second degree. Paulus
&AElig;gineta followed this strange and foolish doctrine
of Galen very closely, as the following extracts
from his book on Materia Medica will show:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cistus (rock-rose).&mdash;It is an astringent shrub
of gently cooling powers. Its leaves and shoots
are so desiccative as to agglutinate wounds; but
the flowers are of a more drying nature, being
about the second degree; and hence, when drunk,
they cure dysenteries and all kinds of fluxes."<a name="FNanchor_IX_2" id="FNanchor_IX_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_IX_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"Ferrum (iron).&mdash;When frequently extinguished
in water, it imparts a considerable desiccative
power to it. When drunk, therefore, it agrees with
affections of the spleen."<a name="FNanchor_IX_3" id="FNanchor_IX_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_IX_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Many features, however, of Galen's teaching and
practice of therapeutics are worthy of praise. He
enunciated two fundamental principles: (1) That
disease is something contrary to Nature, and is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
be overcome by that which is contrary "to the
disease itself"; and (2) that Nature is to be preserved
by what has relation with Nature. He
recognized that while the invading disease was to
be repelled, the strength and constitution of the
patient should be preserved, and that in all cases
the cause of the disease was to be treated and not
the symptoms. Strong remedies should not be
used on weak patients.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">VI.&mdash;Surgery</span>.</h4>

<p>Galen conformed to the custom of the physicians
in Rome, and did not practise surgery to any
extent, although he used the lancet in phlebotomy,
and defended this practice against the followers
of Erasistratus in Rome. He is said to have
resected a portion of the sternum for caries, and
also to have ligatured the temporal artery.<a name="FNanchor_IX_4" id="FNanchor_IX_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_IX_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">VII.&mdash;Gyn&aelig;cology</span>.</h4>

<p>Galen had little more than a superficial knowledge
of this subject, and was quite ignorant of the
surgery of diseases of women. He was not so well
informed as Soranus was as to the anatomy of the
uterus and its appendages, but deserves credit for
having been better acquainted with the anatomy
of the Fallopian tubes than his predecessors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
He had erroneous views on the causation of displacements
of the uterus. Several of the books
inaccurately attributed to the authorship of Galen
deal with the medical treatment of various minor
ailments of women.</p>

<p>Galen was a man of wide culture, and one of his
essays is written for the purpose of urging physicians
to become acquainted with other branches
of knowledge besides medicine. As a philosopher
he has been quoted in company with Plato and
Aristotle, and his philosophical writings were
greatly used by Arabic authors. In philosophy,
as in medicine, he had studied the teachings of
the various schools of thought, and did not bind
himself to any sect in particular. He disagreed
with the Sceptics in their belief that no such thing
as certainty was attainable, and it was his custom
in cases of extreme difficulty to suspend his judgment;
for instance, in reference to the nature of
the soul, he wrote that he had not been able to
come to a definite opinion.</p>

<p>Galen mentions the discreditable conduct of
physicians at consultations. Sometimes several
doctors would hold a consultation, and, apparently
forgetting the patient for the time, would
hold violent disputations. Their main object was
to display their dialectical skill, and their arguments
sometimes led to blows. These discreditable
exhibitions were rather frequent in Rome in
his time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>With Galen, as with Hippocrates, it is sometimes
impossible to tell what works are genuine,
and what are spurious. He seemed to think that
he was the successor of Hippocrates, and wrote:
"No one before me has given the true method of
treating disease: Hippocrates, I confess, has heretofore
shown the path, but as he was the first to
enter it, he was not able to go as far as he wished....
He has not made all the necessary distinctions,
and is often obscure, as is usually the
case with ancients when they attempt to be concise.
He says very little of complicated diseases;
in a word, he has only sketched what another was
to complete; he has opened the path, but has left
it for a successor to enlarge and make it plain."
Galen strictly followed Hippocrates in the latter's
humoral theory of pathology, and also in therapeutics
to a great extent.</p>

<p>It is a speculation of much interest how it was
that Galen's views on Medicine received universal
acceptance, and made him the dictator in this
realm of knowledge for ages after his death. He
was not precisely a genius, though a very remarkable
man, and he established no sect of his own.
The reason of his power lay in the fact that his
writings supplied an encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge of
the medical art down to his own time, with commentaries
and additions of his own, written with
great assurance and conveying an impression of
finality, for he asserted that he had finished what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Hippocrates had begun. The world was tired of
political and philosophical strife, and waiting for
authority. The wars of Rome had resulted in
placing political power in the hands of one man,
the Emperor; the disputations and bickerings of
philosophers and physicians produced a similar
result, and Galen, in the medical world was invested
with the purple.</p>

<p>The effect, therefore, of Galen's writings was, at
first, to add to and consolidate medical knowledge,
but his influence soon became an obstacle to progress.
Even in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, Galenism held almost undisputed sway.</p>

<p>The house of Galen stood opposite the Temple
of Romulus in the Roman Forum. This temple,
in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 530, was consecrated by Pope Felix IV
to the honour of the saints, Cosma and Damiano,
two Arabian <i>anargyri</i> (unpaid physicians) who
suffered martyrdom under Diocletian.</p>

<p>The date of Galen's death is not exactly known,
but was probably <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 200.</p>

<h3>THE LATER ROMAN AND BYZANTINE PERIOD.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Beginning of Decline &mdash; Neoplatonism &mdash; Antyllus &mdash; Oribasius &mdash; Magnus &mdash; Jacobus
Psychristus &mdash; Adamantius &mdash; Meletius &mdash; Nemesius &mdash; &AElig;tius &mdash; Alexander
of Tralles &mdash; The Plague &mdash; Moschion &mdash; Paulus
&AElig;gineta &mdash; Decline of Healing Art.</p></div>

<p>The death of Galen marks the beginning of
the decline of medical science in ancient times,
and this decline was contemporaneous with the
overthrow of the Roman State. As everybody
knows, the decline and fall of the Roman Empire
resulted from the profligacy and incapacity of the
emperors, luxurious living and vice among the
people, tyranny of an overbearing soldiery at
home, and the attacks of barbarian foes gradually
increasing in strength. Rome fell quickly
into the hands of the barbarians, and her power
was broken. In <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 395, was founded the
Byzantine Empire, also styled the East Roman,
Greek, or Lower Empire, which lasted for more
than a thousand years, and took its name from the
capital, Byzantium or Constantinople. In this
empire medical science maintained a feeble and
sickly existence. During this <i>Byzantine Period</i>
there were a few physicians of note, but they
were mainly commentators, and medical science
retrograded rather than progressed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Neoplatonism</i> exerted a powerful influence upon
the healing art. It was founded by Plotinus, and
was for three centuries a formidable rival to
Christianity. The Neoplatonists believed that
man could intuitively know the absolute by a
faculty called <i>Ecstasy</i>. Neoplatonism is a term
which covers a very wide range of varying thought;
essentially, it was a combination of philosophy
and religion, arising from the intellectual movement
in Alexandria. It covered a great deal of
mysticism, magic and spiritualism, and the followers
of the system, as it developed, became believers
in the efficacy of certain exercises and symbols
to cure diseases. They entered as Kingsley
wrote, "the fairy land of ecstasy, clairvoyance,
insensibility to pain, cures produced by the effect
of what we now call mesmerism. They are all
there, these modern puzzles, in those old books
of the long bygone seekers for wisdom." It is
wonderful how mankind in their pursuit of
knowledge seem to have progressed in a circle.</p>

<p>The influence which Christianity exerted upon
the investigation of medical science during the
early centuries of our era will be considered at
length in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p><i>Antyllus</i> was perhaps the greatest surgeon of
antiquity. He lived before the end of the fourth
century <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span>, for he is quoted by Oribasius, but is not
mentioned by Galen. The time in which he lived
was about the year <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 300. He was a voluminous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
writer, but his works have perished except for
quotations by later writers. The fragments of his
writings were collected and published in 1799.
Antyllus performed an operation for aneurism,
which consisted in laying open the sac, turning
out the clots, securing the vessels above and below,
and allowing the wound to heal by granulation.
As this operation was performed without an&aelig;sthetics
or antiseptics it was attended with great
mortality, and the risk of secondary h&aelig;morrhage
was very great. Antyllus had operations for the
cure of stammering, for cataract, and for the treatment
of contractures by the method of tenotomy.
He also removed enlarged glands of the neck. It
was part of the practice of Antyllus to ligature
arteries before cutting them, a method which was
subsequently "rediscovered" owing to neglect of
the study of the history of medicine. He gave
directions for avoiding the carotid artery and
internal jugular vein in operations upon the neck.</p>

<p>A fragment of the writings of Antyllus is preserved
by Paulus &AElig;gineta,<a name="FNanchor_X_1" id="FNanchor_X_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and shows the quality
of the work done in bygone ages. It is his
description of the operation of tracheotomy, and
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we proceed to perform this operation
we must cut through some part of the windpipe,
below the larynx, about the third or fourth ring;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for to divide the whole would be dangerous. This
place is commodious, because it is not covered
with any flesh, and because it has no vessels
situated near the divided part. Therefore, bending
the head of the patient backward, so that the
windpipe may come more forward to the view, we
make a transverse section between two of the rings,
so that in this case not the cartilage but the
membrane which unites the cartilages together,
is divided. If the operator be a little timid, he
may first stretch the skin with a hook and divide
it; then, proceeding to the windpipe, and separating
the vessels, if any are in the way, he may
make the incision." This operation had been
proposed by Asclepiades about three hundred years
before the time of Antyllus.</p>

<p><i>Oribasius</i> was born at Pergamos, the birthplace
of Galen, about <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 326. He studied under <i>Zenon</i>,
who lectured and practised at Alexandria, and was
expelled by the bishop, but afterwards reinstated
by command of the Emperor Julian (<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 361).
When Julian was kept in confinement in Asia
Minor, Oribasius became acquainted with him, and
they were soon close friends. When Julian was
raised to the rank of C&aelig;sar, Oribasius accompanied
him into Gaul. During this journey Oribasius, at
the request of his patron, made an epitome of the
writings of Galen, and then extended the work by
including a collection of the writings of all preceding
medical authors. When this work was finally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
completed it consisted of seventy books under the
title "Collecta Medicinalia." He wrote also for
his friend and biographer Eunapius two books
on diseases and their treatment, and treatises on
anatomy and on the works of Galen. He earned for
himself the title of the Ape of Galen. In the "Life
of Oribasius," by Eunapius, we find that Julian
created Oribasius Qu&aelig;stor of Constantinople, but
after the death of Julian, Oribasius was exiled,
and practised among the "barbarians," attaining
great fame. In his exile he married a rich woman
of good family, and to one of his sons, Eustathius
by name, he addressed an abridgment of his first
great book, the smaller work being called the
"Synopsis." He ultimately returned from exile,
and again reached a very honourable position, to
which he was well entitled in virtue of the great
fortitude with which he had borne adversity.</p>

<p>An edition of Oribasius was published at Paris
between 1851 and 1876, in six volumes, by Daremberg
and Bussemaker, under the patronage of the
French Government. The authors of this edition
took infinite pains to show the sources from which
the writings of Oribasius had been derived, chief
of which were the original writings of Galen,
Hippocrates, Soranus, Rufus, and Antyllus. Oribasius
was almost entirely a compiler, but also did
some original work. To him is due the credit of
describing the drum of the ear and the salivary
glands. He described also the strange disease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
called lycanthropy, a form of insanity in which
the patient thinks himself a wolf, and leaves his
home at night to wander amongst the tombs.</p>

<p>Oribasius was held to be the wisest man of his
time. There was something very charming in his
manner and conversation, and the barbarians considered
him as little less than a god.</p>

<p><i>Magnus</i>, a native of Mesopotamia, was a pupil
of Zenon and lectured at Alexandria. He was
famous for his eloquence and dialectical skill, and
wrote a book on "Urine" which is referred to by
Theophilus.</p>

<p><i>Jacobus Psychristus</i> was a famous physician who
practised at Constantinople, <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 457-474. He
was called "the Saviour" because of the great
success of his treatment.</p>

<p><i>Adamantius</i> of Alexandria both taught and
practised medicine. He was a Jewish physician
who was expelled from Alexandria in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 415, and
settled in Constantinople.</p>

<p><i>Meletius</i> was a Christian monk who lived in the
fourth century, according to some authorities, but
it is probable that he belonged to a later period,
the sixth or seventh century. He wrote on the
nature of man, but the book is of no value as a
contribution to physiology.</p>

<p><i>Nemesius</i>, Bishop of Emissa, at the end of the
fourth century wrote a book called "De Natura
Hominis," and came very close to two important
discoveries, namely, the functions of the bile and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the circulation of the blood. Of the former, he
wrote, "The yellow bile is constituted both for
itself and for other purposes; for it contributes to
digestion and promotes the expulsion of the excrements;
and therefore it is in a manner one of the
nutritive organs, besides imparting a sort of heat
to the body, like the vital power. For these
reasons, therefore, it seems to be made for itself;
but, inasmuch as it purges the blood, it seems to
be made in a manner for this also."<a name="FNanchor_X_2" id="FNanchor_X_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>With reference to the circulation of the blood,
Nemesius wrote: "The motion of the pulse (called
also the vital power) takes its rise from the heart
and chiefly from its left ventricle. The artery is
with great vehemence dilated and contracted, by a
sort of constant harmony and order, the motion
commencing at the heart. While it is dilated it
draws with force the thinner part of the blood
from the neighbouring veins, the exhalation or
vapour of which blood becomes the aliment for the
vital spirit. But while it is contracted it exhales
whatever fumes it has through the whole body and
by secret passages, as the heart throws out whatever
is fuliginous through the mouth and nose by
expiration."<a name="FNanchor_X_3" id="FNanchor_X_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>This book was first translated into English
in 1636.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Nemesius also wrote on religion and philosophy.
In regard to his medical writings, although he did
not go far enough to anticipate the discovery of
Harvey, his contribution to medical science was
remarkable.</p>

<p><i>&AElig;tius</i> was born in Mesopotamia and lived at the
end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth
century. He studied at Alexandria, and settled
at Constantinople, where he attained to the
honour of court chamberlain, and physician to
the Emperor Justinian. He was the first notable
physician to profess Christianity. In compounding
medicines, he recommended that the following
prayer should be repeated in a low voice: "May
the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob deign to bestow upon this
medicament such and such virtues." To extract
a piece of bone sticking in the throat, the physician
should call out loudly: "As Jesus Christ drew
Lazarus from the grave, and as Jonah came out of
the whale, thus Blasius, the martyr and servant
of God, commands, 'Bone, come up or go down.'"</p>

<p>&AElig;tius wrote the "Sixteen Books on Medicine,"
and these contain original matter, but are of value
mainly as being a compilation of the medical
knowledge of his time. He was the first writer
to mention certain Eastern drugs, such as cloves
and camphor, and had a great knowledge of the
spells and charms used in the East, more especially
by the Egyptian Christians. All the nostrums,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
amulets and charms that were used at the time
are enumerated, and display a gloomy picture of
the superstition and ignorance that prevailed.
The surgical and gyn&aelig;cological sections of the
writings of &AElig;tius are, in most parts, excellent.
He treated cut arteries by twisting or tying,
and advised the irrigation of wounds with cold
water. In the operation of lithotomy he recommended
that the blade of the knife should be
guarded by a tube. He used the seton and the
cautery, which was much in vogue in his day, especially
in cases of paralysis. He quotes Archigenes,
who wrote: "I should not at all hesitate to make
an eschar in the nape of the neck, where the spinal
marrow takes its rise, two on each side of it ... and
if the ulcers continue running a good while, I
should not doubt of a perfect recovery."</p>

<p><i>Alexander of Tralles</i> lived from <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 525 to 605.
He was the son of a physician, and one of five
brothers, who were all distinguished for scholarship.
He studied philosophy as well as medicine, and
travelled in France, Spain, and Italy to extend
his knowledge. He took up permanent residence
in Rome, and became very celebrated. When
he became too old to continue active practice, he
found leisure to write twelve books on medical
diseases, following to some extent the teaching
of Galen. The style of these books is elegant, and
his description of diseases accurate. Alexander of
Tralles was the first to open the jugular vein in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
disease, and employed iron and other useful
remedies, but he lived in superstitious times, and
was very credulous. For epilepsy, he recommended
a piece of sail from a wrecked vessel, worn round
the arm for seven weeks.<a name="FNanchor_X_4" id="FNanchor_X_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> For colic, he recommended
the heart of a lark attached to the right
thigh, and for pain in the kidneys an amulet
depicting Hercules overcoming a lion. To exorcise
gout, he used incantations, these being either
oral or written on a thin sheet of gold during
the waning of the moon. Writing a suitable
inscription on an olive leaf, gathered before sunrise,
was his specific for ague. Alexander appears at
times to have doubted the efficacy of such remedies
as amulets, for he explains that his rich patients
would not submit to rational treatment, and it was
necessary, therefore, to use other methods reputed
to be curative.</p>

<p>In the age of Justinian great scourges devastated
the world. In <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 526 Antioch was destroyed by
an earthquake, and it is said that 250,000 people
perished, but the most dreadful visitation on mankind
was the great plague which raged in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 542
and the following years, and, as Gibbon writes,
"depopulated the earth in the time of Justinian
and his successors." <i>Procopius</i>, who was versed in
medicine, was the historian of the period. This
fell disease began between the Serbonian bog and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the eastern channel of the Nile. "From thence,
tracing as it were a double path, it spread to the
east, over Syria, Persia, and the Indies, and penetrated
to the west, along the coast of Africa, and
over the continent of Europe. In the spring of the
second year, Constantinople, during three or four
months, was visited by the pestilence; and Procopius,
who observed its progress and symptoms with
the eyes of a physician, has emulated the skill and
diligence of Thucydides in the latter's description of
the plague of Athens. The infection was sometimes
announced by the visions of a distempered fancy,
and the victim despaired as soon as he had heard
the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible
spectre. But the greater number, in their beds, in
the streets, in their usual occupation, were surprised
by a slight fever, so slight, indeed, that
neither the pulse nor the colour of the patient gave
any signs of the approaching danger. The same,
the next, or the succeeding day, it was declared by
the swelling of the glands, particularly those of the
groin, of the armpits, and under the ear; and
when these buboes or tumours were opened they
were found to contain a <i>coal</i>, or black substance, of
the size of a lentil. If they came to a first swelling
and suppuration, the patient was saved by this
kind and natural discharge of the morbid humour.
But if they continued hard and dry, a mortification
quickly ensued, and the fifth day was commonly the
term of his life. The fever was often accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
with lethargy or delirium; the bodies of the sick
were covered with black pustules or carbuncles,
the symptoms of immediate death; and in the
constitutions too feeble to produce an eruption, the
vomiting of blood was followed by a mortification
of the bowels. To pregnant women the plague
was generally mortal; yet one infant was drawn
alive from its dead mother, and three mothers
survived the loss of their infected f&oelig;tus. Youth
was the most perilous season: and the female sex
was less susceptible than the male; but every rank
and profession was attacked with indiscriminate
rage, and many of those who escaped were
deprived of their speech, without being secure from
a return of the disorder. The physicians of
Constantinople were zealous and skilful, but their
art was baffled by the various symptoms and
pertinacious vehemence of the disease; the same
remedies were productive of contrary effects and
the event capriciously disappointed their prognostics
of death or recovery. The order of funerals
and the right of sepulchres were confounded;
those who were left without friends or servants
lay unburied in the streets, or in their desolate
houses; and a magistrate was authorized to collect
the promiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport
them by land or water, and to inter them in deep
pits beyond the precincts of the city.... No
facts have been preserved to sustain an account, or
even a conjecture, of the number that perished in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
this extraordinary mortality. I only find, that
during three months 5,000, and at length 10,000,
persons died each day at Constantinople; that
many cities of the East were left vacant, and that
in several districts of Italy the harvest and the
vintage withered on the ground."<a name="FNanchor_X_5" id="FNanchor_X_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The spread of disease from East to West was
again exemplified in the Middle Ages, in the time
of the Crusades, when the Crusaders carried home
diseases to their native lands. The Knights of
St. John, it is interesting to observe, superintended
hospitals at home, and wore the white
dress which in earlier times had distinguished the
Asclepiades.</p>

<p><i>Moschion</i> probably lived in the sixth century,
and was a specialist in diseases of women. His
writings were studied when Soranus was forgotten,
but in course of time it was discovered that
Moschion's work was nothing but an abbreviated
translation of the works of Soranus. "Further,
it is held by Weber and Ermerins that even the
original Moschion is not based directly on Soranus,
but on a work on diseases of women written in the
fourth century by C&aelig;lius Aurelianus, who in his
turn drew from Soranus.... It is interesting
to follow the history of this book through its
various stages in the light of these different
editions, and we would suggest that the first Latin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
version, for the use of Latin-speaking matrons
and midwives, was produced before the fall of
the Western Empire in the fifth century; its
Greek sister just fits in with the development
of Eastern or Greek-speaking Empire at
Constantinople in the sixth century; and the
version in barbarous Latin points to a later period,
when learning was beginning to make way again in
Western Europe."<a name="FNanchor_X_6" id="FNanchor_X_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Moschion's book is a catechism
consisting of 152 questions and answers.</p>

<p><i>Paulus &AElig;gineta</i> was the last, and one of the
most famous, of the Greek physicians. He was
born probably in the seventh century in the island
of &AElig;gina, but there is some doubt as to the exact
period in which he lived. He quotes Alexander
of Tralles and &AElig;tius, and therefore lived at a later
period than they did, either in the sixth or seventh
century. The works of Paulus are compilations,
but reveal the skill and learning of the author.
He wrote several books, but only one, and that the
principal, remains, and is known by the title of
"De Re Medica Libri Septem." Dr. Adams, of
Banchory, translated this book for the Sydenham
Society, and the introduction shows the scope of
the work: "In the first book you will find
everything that relates to hygiene, and to the
preservation from, and correction of, distempers
peculiar to the various ages, reasons, temperaments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and so forth; also the powers and use of
the different articles of food, as is set forth in the
chapter of contents. In the second is explained
the whole doctrine of fevers, an account of certain
matters relating to them being premised, such as
excrementitious discharges, critical days, and other
appearances, and concluding with certain symptoms
which are the concomitants of fevers. The third
book relates to topical affections, beginning from
the crown of the head and descending down to the
nails of the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: Extra closing double quote mark removed.">feet,</ins> and so on. Briefly, the fourth
book treats of external diseases; the fifth, of wounds
and bites from venomous animals; the sixth book
is the most important and is devoted to surgery,
and contains original observations, and the seventh
book contains an account of the properties of
medicines." Paulus wrote a famous book on
obstetrics, which is now lost, but it gained for him
among the Arabs the title of "the accoucheur."</p>

<p>The sixth book on surgery, as has justly been
observed by Adams, "contains the most complete
system of operative surgery which has come down
to us from ancient times." Many important
surgical principles are enunciated, such, for instance,
as local depletion as against general, and
the merit of a free external incision. He first
described varicose aneurism, and performed the
operation of bronchotomy as described by Antyllus.
He favoured the lateral operation for removal
of stone from the bladder, and amputated the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
cancerous breast by crucial incision. He also had
an operation, like that of Antyllus, for the cure of
aneurism. In brief, Paulus performed many of the
operations that are practised at the present day.
He travelled in the practice of his calling, and not
only had great fame in the Byzantine Empire and
in Arabia in his lifetime, but exercised great
influence for some centuries. His writings inspired
Albucassis, one of the few surgeons and teachers
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>After the time of Paulus &AElig;gineta the practice
of medicine and surgery suffered a very rapid
decline, and for five centuries no progress was
made. The Middle Ages form a dark and melancholy
period in the history of medicine, and we
have to come to comparatively recent times before
we find the skill and knowledge of the Ancients
equalled, while it is only at the present day that
they are rapidly being excelled.</p>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY ON ALTRUISM AND
THE HEALING ART.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Essenes &mdash; Cabalists and Gnostics &mdash; Object of Christ's Mission &mdash; Stoics &mdash; Constantine

<p>The sect of the <i>Essenes</i> embraced part of the
teaching of Christianity among their other beliefs.
They conceived that the Almighty had to be
propitiated by signs and symbols. Words, they
considered, were the direct gift of God to man,
and, therefore, signs representing words were of
great avail. Hence arose the use of amulets and
cabalistic signs, or, rather, the common use, for
they had been in evidence long prior to the
foundation of this sect. Amulets were worn on
the person. The Jews had phylacteries or bits
of parchment on which were written passages
from the Scriptures. In the first century after
Christ, Jews, Pythagoreans, Essenes, and various
sects of mystics combined and formed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<i>Cabalists</i> and <i>Gnostics</i>. Their creed embraced the
magic of the Persians, the dreams of the Asclepiads,
the numbers of Pythagoras, and the theory
of atoms of Democritus. The Sophists of
Alexandria actually regarded magic as a science.
A section of the early Christians were Gnostics,
and were imbued with the philosophy of the
Orientals. According to the beliefs of the Cabalists
and Gnostics, demons were the cause of disease.
These sects interrogated evil spirits to find out
where they lurked, and exorcised them with the
help of charms and talismans. Various geometric
figures and devices were held to have power against
evil spirits. One of these figures was the device of
two triangles interlaced thus &#10017;. This was used
as a symbol of God, not only by Cabalists and
Gnostics, but also by Jews. The great majority
of the early Christians opposed the Gnostics, and
repudiated and abhorred their strange mixture of
the Christian religion with Eastern philosophy.</p>

<p>Christ came into the world at a time when the
evils of <i>slavery</i> were probably at their worst. He
did not directly condemn slavery, and the reason
of this is to be found in the study of the nature of
His mission. He came to regenerate the individual,
and not, primarily, society. "His language in
innumerable similes showed that <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note: Original had 'he' instead of 'He'.">He</ins> believed that
those principles He taught would only be successful
after long periods of time and gradual development.
Most of His figures and analogies in regard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to 'the Kingdom of God' rest upon the idea of
slow and progressive growth or change. He undoubtedly
saw that the only true renovation of
the world would come, not through reforms of
institutions or governments, but through individual
change of character, effected by the same power to
which Plato appealed&mdash;the love-power&mdash;but a love
exercised towards Himself as a perfect and Divine
model. It was the 'Kingdom of God' in the soul
which should bring on the kingdom of God in
human society.... And yet ultimately this
Christian system will be found at the basis of all
these great movements of progress in human
history. But it began by aiming at the individual,
and not at society; and aiming alone
at an entire change of the affectional and moral
tendencies."<a name="FNanchor_XI_1" id="FNanchor_XI_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The moral teaching of the <i>Stoics</i>, second only
to that of the Christian religion, had an effect in
preparing the way for the introduction of humane
principles of treatment for the bond and the
oppressed. But the Stoics, like many of the
Christians, did not always make their actions
accord with their principles. Seneca tells of a
Stoic who amused himself by feeding his fish with
pieces of his mutilated slaves. Juvenal, who wrote
when Stoicism was at the height of its influence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
asks "how a slave could be a man," and Gaius, the
Stoical jurist, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius,
classes slaves with animals.</p>

<p>Constantine, in his own character, did not display
the beauties of the Christian religion, though
his advisers who framed his laws acted under
the influence of Christian teaching. This emperor
passed laws in reference to slavery. He wrote to
an archbishop: "It has pleased me for a long
time to establish that, in the Christian Church,
masters can give liberty to their slaves, provided
they do it in presence of all the assembled people
with the assistance of Christian priests, and provided
that, in order to preserve the memory of the
fact, some written document informs where they
sign as parties or as witnesses." In pagan times
there was a somewhat similar system of a master
being able to redeem a slave and register the
redemption in one of the temples.</p>

<p>The laws of Justinian, influenced largely by the
teaching of Christianity, did a great deal to relieve
the burdens of slavery. "We do not transfer
persons from a free condition into a servile&mdash;we
have so much at heart to raise slaves to liberty."
In the words of one of the Early Fathers of the
Church, "No Christian is a slave; those born again
are all brothers."</p>

<p><i>Gladiatorial Games</i> were condemned by the
Stoics, but these philosophers did not influence the
common people. Constantine, in the year before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
his acceptance of Christianity, gave a multitude
of prisoners as prey to the wild beasts of the
arena. In <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 325 he promulgated this law:
"Bloody spectacles, in our present state of tranquillity
and domestic peace, do not please us;
wherefore we order that all gladiators be prohibited
from carrying on their profession." Human sacrifices,
which at one time took place in Rome,
even in the time of Pliny and Seneca, were
abolished under the same influence as checked
gladiatorial sports.</p>

<p>Constantine passed laws against the licentious
plays and spectacles which flourished in Greece
and Rome in pagan times.</p>

<p>Seneca wrote: "Monstrous offspring we destroy;
children too, if weak and unnaturally formed from
birth, we drown. It is not anger, but reason, thus
to separate the useless from the sound."<a name="FNanchor_XI_2" id="FNanchor_XI_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Julius
Paulus, a Stoic, in the time of the Emperor
Severus (<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 222), held that the mother who procured
abortion, starved her child, or exposed it to
die, was, in each case, equally guilty of murder.
The Christian Fathers, in opposing these evils, were
acting in accordance with the teaching of their
founder, and they incessantly condemned these
evil practices, and with greater and more far-reaching
power than the Stoics. Although the
Stoics anticipated many of the reforms of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Christians, Stoicism never had any penetrating
effect on the masses of the people, and differed
in this respect from Christianity. The chief
obstacle to the prevention of the exposure of
children was the great amount of pauperism which
prevailed in the Roman Empire, and Christian
emperors and councils had no choice but to allow
many of these unfortunate children to be taken as
slaves, rather than that they should perish from
cold and hunger, or be torn by ravenous beasts.
The pagan emperors, it is true, had done something
to found orphanages, but these institutions
were not common until the Middle Ages. Trajan
in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 100 supported 5,000 children at the expense
of the State, and endowments were created
by him for this purpose. Hadrian, Antoninus,
and Marcus Aurelius made similar benefactions,
and Pliny endowed a charity for poor children.</p>

<p>In the pre-Christian period, social clubs existed
for the purpose of people having meals together,
helping one another, and providing burial funds.
The Emperor Julian condemned the Christians for
supporting not only their own poor, but also poor
strangers outside their faith. For ages the Church
took charge of the poor. Her enemies said that as
much pauperism was created as was relieved, and,
no doubt, as is usual in the distribution of charity,
the good done was not unmixed with evil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hospitals.</span></h4>

<p>With reference to the important question of the
foundation of hospitals, there are two opposing
opinions&mdash;one, attributing their foundation almost
entirely to Christianity,<a name="FNanchor_XI_3" id="FNanchor_XI_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and the other denying
to Christianity any pre-eminent influence.<a name="FNanchor_XI_4" id="FNanchor_XI_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
truth lies between these two conflicting views, but
nearer to the statement of Mr. Brace than of Mr.
McCabe. The truths and influences of Christianity,
in the mind of the latter author, are
obscured by the many errors of the Church, especially
in the Early and Middle Ages; and it is of the
utmost importance to distinguish, where necessary,
between the teaching of the Founder of Christianity
as disclosed in the New Testament, and the
teaching of the Church which made many very
evident errors, and whose practice soon became
different from that inculcated by its Founder,
so that at times the Christianity of the Church
was as different from Christ's teaching as the
vine of Sodom from the grapes of Eshcol. The
fact that Christianity emerged from this eclipse
points to it as something more than a humanly
devised system.</p>

<p>In very early times, the sick were allowed to
remain at the temples for the treatment of their
diseases, and medical students also attended for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
instruction. This system was the hospital system
of later times, although the temples were not
hospitals in the present sense of the word. The
system in vogue in the temples of &AElig;sculapius
in Greece and Rome has already been described
in this book, but the temples of Saturn served
the same purpose in Egypt four thousand years
before Christ. Professor Ebers of Leipzig, a high
authority on the subject, says that Heliopolis undoubtedly
had a clinique in connection with the
temple. The Emperor Asoka founded many hospitals
in Hindustan, and Buddhists and Mohammedans
both possessed hospitals ("Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica").</p>

<p>Patients were attracted to temples, not only by
receiving the services of the priest-physicians, but
also in the superstitious belief that special virtue
attached to the precincts of sacred buildings.
Thus, in the temples of &AElig;sculapius, sick people
tried to get as near to the altar as possible. "It
may fairly be surmised that the disuse of these
temples in Christian times made the necessity of
hospitals more apparent, and so led to their institution,
in much the same way as in this country
the suppression of monasteries, which had largely
relieved the indigent poor, made the necessity of
poor laws immediately evident."<a name="FNanchor_XI_5" id="FNanchor_XI_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> During Hadrian's
reign the first notice of a military hospital appears.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>iatria</i>, or <i>tabern&aelig; medic&aelig;</i>, described by
Galen and others, were not for in-patients, but
of the nature of dispensaries for the reception of
out-patients. Seneca refers to valetudinaria, rooms
set aside for the sick in large private houses. The
first hospital in Rome in Christian times was
founded by Fabiola, a wealthy lady, at the end of
the fourth century. Attached to it was a convalescent
home in the country. Pulcheria, later, built
and endowed several hospitals at Constantinople,
and these subsequently increased in number. Pauline
abandoned wealth and social position and went
to Jerusalem, and there established a hospital and
sisterhood under the direction of St. Jerome. St.
Augustine founded a hospital at Hippo. McCabe
states justly: "In the new religious order a
philanthropic heroism was evolved that was
certainly new to Europe. In the whole story of
Stoicism there is no figure like that of a
Catherine of Sienna sucking the sores of a leper,
or a Vincent de Paul." It appears evident
that Christianity was an important factor in the
foundation of hospitals and charitable institutions,
not directly, but from its beneficent influence
on the character of individuals; and the
Roman Church, in this respect, acted in conformity
with the teachings of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Of greater importance is the consideration of
the influence of Christianity, and of the Church,
on the investigation and elimination of disease.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
In this matter the Church deserves the severest
censure. It is no exaggeration to say that she
hindered the scientific progress of the world for
centuries. She applied to the explanation of the
causation of disease, the <i>demon theories</i> inherited
from Egypt, Persia, and the East. The Bible
itself reflects the views on demonology current at
the time of the events recorded. If demons were
the cause of disease, logically the treatment of
diseases should have been in the hands of priests,
not of physicians. The priests held that they
were the proper people to interpret the will of the
Almighty; diseases were direct dispensations of
Providence.</p>

<p>"It is demons," says Origen, "which produce
famine, unfruitfulness, corruptions of the air, and
pestilence. They hover concealed in clouds, in
the lower atmosphere, and are attracted by the
blood and incense which the heathen offer to them
as gods."<a name="FNanchor_XI_6" id="FNanchor_XI_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "All diseases of Christians," wrote
Augustine, "are to be ascribed to these demons:
chiefly do they torment fresh-baptized Christians,
yea! even the guiltless new-born infants." Hippocrates,
long before the Christian era, wrote with
great wisdom in reference to the so-called sacred
diseases: "To me it appears that such affections
are just as much divine as all others are,
and that no one disease is either more divine or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
more human than another; but all are alike divine,
for each has its own nature, and no one arises
without a natural cause."<a name="FNanchor_XI_7" id="FNanchor_XI_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The devil might be driven out in disgust, it was
thought, by the use of disgusting materials&mdash;ordure,
the grease made from executed criminals, the livers
of toads, the blood of rats, and so on. The same
belief in demoniacal possession led to the most
inhuman treatment of lunatics, and the Church
in this respect is put to shame when we compare
its action with the wiser and more humane practice
of the Moors. This belief helped to strangle medical
progress for centuries, and is directly attributable
to the Church. As late as 1583, the Jesuit
fathers at Vienna boasted that they had cast out
12,642 devils. That God dispenses both health
and disease is a very different belief from that involved
in "demoniacal possession." Travellers in
remote parts of the East at the present day tell of
alleged cases of demoniacal possession, but investigation
does not reveal any difference between these
cases and epilepsy or acute mania.</p>

<p>In the first centuries of the Christian era men
demanded overt signs of the favour of God, and
the objects of veneration kept in the churches and
monasteries were held to be capable of curing
disease. The Latin Church had either a saint
or a relic of a saint to cure nearly every ill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that flesh is heir to. St. Apollonia was invoked
against toothache; St. Avertin against lunacy;
St. Benedict against stone; St. Clara against
sore eyes; St. Herbert in hydrophobia; St. John
in epilepsy; St. Maur in gout; St. Pernel in
ague; St. Genevieve in fever; St. Sebastian in
plague; St. Ottila for diseases of the head; St.
Blazius for the neck; St. Laurence and St.
Erasmus for the body; St. Rochus and St. John
for diseases of the legs and feet. St. Margaret
was invoked for diseases of children and the
dangers of childbirth.</p>

<p>What the influence of Christ's life on earth on the
medical art of His time was is a difficult question.
It must be remembered that He came to save the
souls and not the bodies of men, not to rapidly
alter social conditions nor to teach science. The
eternal life of man was <i>the</i> subject of transcendent
importance, and it is no doubt true that
many of the early Christians neglected their
bodies for the cure of their souls. As against
this, the gospel of love taught that all men are
brothers, both bond and free, and this led to
mutual help in physical suffering, and to the
foundation of charitable institutions. In the times
of persecution of the Christians many of them
welcomed suffering and death as the portal to
eternal bliss.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that the <i>miraculous cures</i>
wrought by Christ for His own purposes were an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
intimation to His followers to neglect the ordinary
means of natural cure, and that this placed a
Christian doctor in the position of having to
abandon his calling. This is not so. To St. Luke&mdash;a
Christian physician and the writer of the
third Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles&mdash;the
performance by Christ of miracles of healing presented
no difficulties, for he was the travelling
medical adviser of St. Paul, and accompanied
him on three journeys, from Troas to Philippi,
from Philippi to Jerusalem, and from C&aelig;sarea
to Rome (<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 62). St. Paul wrote: "For we
would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our
trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were
pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch
that we despaired even of life, but we had the
sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not
trust in ourselves, but in God, which raiseth the
dead: who delivered us from so great a death, and
doth deliver: in whom we trust that He will yet
deliver us." St. Paul exercised faith, but also
used the means of cure prescribed by "the beloved
physician." In a very scholarly book published
by the Dublin University Press in 1882, the Rev.
W. K. Hobart, LL.D., shows that St. Luke was
acquainted with the technical medical terms of
the Greek medical writers. St. Luke was an
Asiatic Greek. Dr. Hobart writes: "Finally, it
should not be left out of account that, in any
illness from which he might be suffering, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was no one to whom St. Paul would be likely to
apply with such confidence as to St. Luke, for it
is probable that, in the whole extent of the Roman
Empire, the only Christian physician at this time
was St. Luke." In later years the pretence of
performing miracles to cure diseases had a great
effect in advancing superstition and retarding
scientific investigation.</p>

<p>Tacitus and Suetonius record miracles alleged
to have been performed by Vespasian. He is said
to have anointed the eyes of a blind man at
Alexandria with the royal spittle, and to have
restored his sight. Another case was that of a man
who had lost the use of his hands, and Vespasian
touched them with his foot and thus restored their
function. It is interesting to follow the career of
Proclus, the last rector of the Neoplatonic School,
"whose life," says Gibbon, "with that of his
scholar Isidore, composed by two of their most
learned disciples, exhibits a most deplorable picture
of the second childhood of human reason." By
long fasting and prayer Proclus pretended to
possess the supernatural power of expelling all
diseases.</p>

<p>The priests of the Church denounced the
practice of <i>Anatomy</i>, and so changed the progress
made by the Alexandrian School, and by
men like Galen, into the ignorance of a thousand
years. The body was the temple of the Holy
Ghost, and should not therefore be desecrated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
dissection. "Strangers' rests" and hospitals were
connected with the monasteries, and were exceedingly
useful, notably in the time of the
Crusades, but these Church institutions were in
a very insanitary condition, for the maxim that
cleanliness is next to godliness had little application
among the religious orders of the Middle Ages.
Dr. Walsh attempts to show that the Reformers
blackened the fair fame of the Church they had
left, and states that it is to "this unfortunate
state of affairs, and not real opposition on the
part of the Popes to science," that we owe the
belief in "the supposed opposition between the
Church and Science."<a name="FNanchor_XI_8" id="FNanchor_XI_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_XI_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> That the Popes did something
to foster medical science in a spasmodic
kind of way, that papal physicians were appointed
and that the Church exercised control over some
seats of learning may be freely admitted. That
the monasteries preserved some of the Latin
classics that they were not all corrupt, and that
all monks were not ignorant and idle, are facts
beyond dispute. No doubt, too, the enemies of
Christianity have overstated their case, but when
all is said, the fact remains that the Church enjoyed
great opportunities for promoting knowledge and
investigating disease, and failed to avail itself of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
them to such an extent that for ages no real progress
was made. This is certainly not an extreme
opinion. It would be nearer the truth to say that
not only was no progress made, but that the
advances made by Hippocrates, by the school of
Alexandria, by Celsus, and by Galen, were lost.</p>

<p>In conclusion, in spite of the dreadful blunders
and perversions of the Church in the Early and
Middle Ages, and the partial eclipse which
Christianity suffered, the teaching of its Founder
slowly but surely ended the harsh and cruel ways
of the pagans, and was the prime factor in promoting
the altruism of later times, of which
medical knowledge and medical service form a
very important part.</p>

<h3>GYMNASIA AND BATHS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Gymnastics &mdash; Vitruvius &mdash; Opinions of Ancient Physicians on
Gymnastics &mdash; The Athletes &mdash; The Baths &mdash; Description of
Baths at Pompeii &mdash; Therm&aelig; &mdash; Baths of Caracalla.</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gymnastics</span>.</h4>

<p>Gymnastics were held in such high repute in
ancient Greece that physical training occupied as
much time in the education of boys as all their
other studies, and was continued through life with
modifications to suit the altering requirements of
age and occupation. The Greeks fully recognized
that mental culture could not reach its highest
perfection if the development of the body were
neglected. Lucian attributes not only the bodily
grace of the Ancient Greeks, but also their mental
pre-eminence, to the gymnastic exercises which
they practised. They were also an important factor
in the excellence of Greek sculpture, and probably
the most important part of their medical treatment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the baths of the Romans and
the gymnasia of the Greeks became in time
the haunts of the lazy and voluptuous. The
gymnastic exercises of the Greeks date from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
very early times, and at first were of a warlike
nature, and not reduced to a system. Each town
possessed a gymnasium, and three very important
ones were situated at Athens.</p>

<p>Vitruvius describes the general plan of an ancient
gymnasium. It comprised a great stadium capable
of accommodating a vast concourse of spectators,
many porticoes where athletes exercised and
philosophers and sages held discussions and
lectured, walks and shady groves, and baths and
anointing rooms. The buildings, in true Grecian
fashion, were made very beautiful, being adorned
with statues and works of art, and situated in
pleasant surroundings.</p>

<p>Up to the age of 16 boys were instructed in gymnastics,
in music and in grammar, and from 16 to 18
in gymnastics alone. The laws of Solon regulated
the use of the gymnasia, and for very many years
these laws were strictly enforced. It appears that
married women did not attend the gymnasia, and
unmarried women only in some parts of Greece,
such as Sparta, but this custom was relaxed in
later years.</p>

<p>The office of Gymnasiarch (Superintendent of
Gymnasia) was one of great honour, but involved
also a great deal of expense to the holder of the
office. He wore a purple cloak and white shoes.
Officers were appointed to supervise the morals
and conduct of the boys and youths, and the
Gymnasiarch had power to expel people whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
teaching or example might be injurious to the
young.</p>

<p>Galen relates that the chief teachers of the gymnasia
were capable of prescribing suitable exercises,
and thus had powers of medical supervision.</p>

<p>Before exercises were commenced, the body was
anointed, and fine sand or dust applied. Regulation
of the diet was considered of very great importance.</p>

<p>The games of the gymnasia were many and
various, including games of ball, tug-of-war, top-spinning,
and a game in which five stones were
placed on the back of the hand, thrown upwards,
and caught in the palm. One kind of game or
exercise consisted in throwing a rope over a high
post, when two boys took the ends of the rope,
one boy on each side, the one trying to pull the
other up. The most important exercises, however,
were running, walking, throwing the discus, jumping,
wrestling, boxing, and dancing.</p>

<p>The first public gymnasium in Rome was built
by the Emperor Nero. In the time of the Republic
Greek exercises were held in contempt by the
Romans, and the first gymnasia in Rome were
small, and connected only with private houses or
villas.</p>

<p>The gymnasia were dedicated to Apollo, the god
of healing, and exercises were considered of greater
importance for restoring health than medicinal
treatment. The directors of the gymnasia were
in reality physicians, and acted as such. Plato<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
states that one of these, Iccus by name, was the
inventor of medical gymnastics. As in our own
day, many creditable gymnasts, originally weak of
body, had perfected their strength by systematic
exercise and careful dieting.</p>

<p>Hippocrates had occasion to protest against
prolonged and laborious exercises, and excessive
massage, and recommended his own system, that
of moderation. He applied massage to reduce
swellings in suitable cases, and also recognized
that the same treatment was capable of increasing
nutrition, and of producing increased growth and
development. Hippocrates described exercises of
the kind now known as Swedish, consisting of free
movements without resistance.</p>

<p>Galen generally followed the teaching of Hippocrates
on gymnastics, and wrote a whole book on
the merits of using the strigil. Oribasius, and
Antyllus, too, in their writings, recommend special
exercises which appealed to their judgment.</p>

<p>The ancient physicians had great faith in the
efficacy of exercises in cases of dropsy, and Asclepiades
employed this method of treatment very
extensively, using also pleasant medicaments, so
that Pliny said "this physician made himself the
delight of mankind." Patients suffering from
consumption were commonly sent to Alexandria
to benefit from the climate, but Celsus considered
the sea voyage most beneficial because the
patient was exercised bodily by the motion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
ship. Germanicus was cured by riding exercise,
and Cicero was strengthened by travelling and
massage.</p>

<p>From the writings of Greek and Roman
physicians there is no other conclusion to be
drawn but that exercises and gymnastics were
in great vogue for medical purposes, and were of
the utmost benefit. It seems likely that the
exercises of the Greeks, and the baths of the
Romans, both freed from the abuses which took
away in time from their merits, could be adopted
at the present day and encouraged by physicians
with great advantage to their patients. There is
a strong tendency at present in that direction.</p>

<p>Belonging to a different class were the contests
of the athletes, who, except in very early times
in Greece, were people of the baser sort whose
bodies were developed to the neglect of their
minds. Those who underwent the severest training
ate enormous quantities of meat, and tried to
cultivate bulk and weight rather than strength.
They did not compete, as a rule, after the age
of thirty-five years. Euripides considered these
athletes an encumbrance on the State. Plato
said they were very subject to disease, without
grace of manner, violent, and brutal. Aristotle
declared that the athletes had not the active
vigour that good citizens ought to possess.</p>

<p>The athletes and gladiators of Rome were mostly
Greeks. Both Plutarch and Galen deride them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
The former condemned the whole business, and
Galen wrote six chapters to warn young men
against becoming athletes. He said that man is
linked to the divine and also to the lower animals,
that the link with animals was developed by
athletics, and that athletes were immoderate in
eating, sleeping, and exertion, and were therefore
unhealthy, and more liable than other people to
disease and sudden death. Their brutal strength
was of use only on rare occasions and unsuited for
war, or for useful work.</p>

<p>In the time of St. Paul, the athletes were
evidently abstemious, for he wrote "every man
who striveth in the games is temperate in all
things," but in Rome, at most periods of their
history this class of men was notorious for grossness
and brutality.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Baths</span> (<i>Balne&aelig;</i>).</h4>

<p><i>Greek Baths.</i>&mdash;In Greece from very early times
inability to read and to swim were considered the
marks of the ignorant. In Homer's time over-indulgence
in warm baths was considered effeminate.<a name="FNanchor_XII_1" id="FNanchor_XII_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_XII_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The system of bathing was never so
complete in Greece as in Rome, but in the
former country there were both public and private
baths, and ancient Greek vases display pictures
of swimming-baths and shower-baths, and also of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
large basins for men and for women round which
they stood to bathe. The Greek baths were
near the gymnasia. After the bath, the bathers
were anointed with oil and took refreshments.
Sometimes a material consisting of a lye made
of lime or wood-ashes, of nitrum and of fuller's
earth was applied to the body. Towels and strigils
were employed for rubbing and scraping after the
anointing; the strigil was, as a rule, made of iron.</p>

<p>Natural warm springs used for curative purposes
are mentioned by ancient Greek writers.</p>

<p><i>Roman Baths.</i>&mdash;Bathing, which was not much
in vogue in Rome in the most ancient times, was
more common during the Republic, and became a
factor in the decay of the nation in the time of the
Empire. Seneca informs us that the ancient
Romans washed their arms and legs every day and
their whole bodies once a week. The bath-room
was near the kitchen in the Roman house, to be
convenient for the supply of hot water. Scipio's
bath was "small and dark after the manner of the
ancients." In the time of Cicero, the use of baths,
both public and private, was general, and hot-water
and hot-air baths are both mentioned. It has been
computed that there were 856 baths in Rome in
the time of Constantine.</p>

<p>The public baths were at first used only by the
poor, but the mother of Augustus went to the public
bath, and in time even the emperors patronized
them. The baths were opened at sunrise and closed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
at sunset except in the time of Alexander Severus,
when they were open also at night. The charges
for admission were very low. The ringing of a
bell announced that the bath was ready. Baths
were taken seven or eight times in succession
when the people were given to luxury, and some of
them wasted almost the whole day there. The
voluptuaries of the Empire bathed not only before
the principal meal of the day, but also afterwards
to promote digestion as they thought. The perspiration
induced by the bath took the place of
honest sweat induced by work or exercise, and
excessive hot-bathing and perspiring in some cases
had a fatal ending.</p>

<p>Galen and Celsus differ in their directions to
bathers. Galen recommended first the hot-air
bath, next the hot-water bath, then the cold bath
and finally rubbing; Celsus recommended sweating
first in the tepid chamber, then in the hot chamber,
and next the pouring of hot, then tepid, and lastly,
cold water over the head, followed by the use of
the strigil, and anointing and rubbing.</p>

<p>The plan of the baths at Pompeii, which was
largely a pleasure resort, is typical of the public
baths that were in general use. These baths had
several entrances, and the principal one led to a
covered portico from which a lavatory opened.
The portico ran round three sides of a courtyard
(<i>atrium</i>) in which the attendants waited, and it
was also the exercise-yard for the young men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Advertisements of the theatres and gladiatorial
shows were exhibited on the walls of the atrium.
The undressing room was also the reception room
and meeting-place. The bathers' garments were
handed over for custody to slaves, who were, as a
general rule, a very dishonest class. The <i>frigidarium</i>
contained a cold bath 13 ft. 8 in. in
diameter, and a little less than 4 ft. deep. It
had two marble steps, and a seat under water 10 in.
from the bottom. Water ran into the bath through
a bronze spout, and there was a conduit for the
outflow, and an overflow pipe. The frigidarium
opened into the <i>tepidarium</i> which was heated with
hot air from furnaces, and furnished with a charcoal
brazier and benches. The brazier at Pompeii
was 7 ft. long and 2&frac12; ft. broad. The tepidarium
was commonly a beautifully ornamented apartment,
while the anointing-room was conveniently situated
off it. Pliny has described the various unguents
used by wealthy and luxurious Romans. From
the tepidarium the bather might enter the <i>caldarium</i>
or sweating room, an apartment constructed
with double walls and floor, between
which hot air was made to pass. This room
contained a <i>labrum</i>, or circular marble basin, containing
cold water for pouring over the head before
the bather left the caldarium. The method of
heating rooms by passing hot air between the
"hanging" and the lower floor was in use in the
better class of houses, and the device can at present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
be seen in some of the buildings on the Palatine
Hill in Rome, and in the ruins of the great Baths
of Caracalla. After a course of sweating the
bather had the sweat removed from his body by
the strigil, in much the same way as a horse is
scraped with a bent piece of hoop-iron by a groom.
The <i>guttus</i> was a small vessel with a narrow neck
adapted for dropping oil on the strigil to lubricate
its working edge. Pliny states that invalids used
sponges instead of strigils. Rubbing with towels
followed the use of the strigil, and the bather
finally lounged in the tepidarium for a varying
period before entering the outer air.</p>

<p>The boilers in use at Pompeii were three in
number. The lowest one, immediately over the
furnace, contained the hottest water. The next
above and a short distance to the side held tepid
water, and the farthest removed contained cold
water. This system was economical because as
the very hot water was drawn off from the lowest
boiler a supply of tepid water flowed down from
the boiler next above, and from the highest to
the middle boiler.</p>

<p>A smaller suite of bathing apartments adjoining
the men's establishment was for the use of women.</p>

<p>The most important baths formed only a part
of the great establishments called <i>therm&aelig;</i>.
Adjoining the baths of the therm&aelig; were a gymnasium
for sports and exercises, a library for the
studious, lounging places for the idle, halls for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
poets and philosophers, in which they declaimed
and lectured, museums of art, and sometimes
shady groves. These complete establishments
were first erected by Marcus Agrippa in the time
of Augustus. Succeeding emperors vied with each
other in providing magnificent therm&aelig;, and the
ruins of the Baths of Caracalla remain in a
wonderful state of preservation to this day. The
building of these baths began in <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 216. The
structure, 1,050 ft. long and 1,390 ft. broad, was on
a scale of almost incredible magnificence. Priceless
statues and rare objects of art have been
unearthed from the ruins. In recent years excavations
have revealed a complicated system of
subterranean corridors and galleries which existed
for the purpose of carrying leaden water-pipes to
the baths, and providing a passage-way for the
host of slaves who acted as bath-attendants. The
great buildings were well lit by windows in the
walls of the courtyards, and these openings also
allowed for ventilation. A great stadium and beautiful
gardens adjoined the Baths of Caracalla. In
the north-west section of these baths Alessio Valle
has very recently discovered the remains of a great
public library. When Caracalla pillaged Alexandria
he probably carried off many of the books
from the famous library there to enrich his baths.
The ruins of the library in the Baths of Caracalla
reveal circular tiers of galleries for the display of
manuscripts and papyri. There were 500 rooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
round these baths. The great hall had a ceiling
made in one span, and the roof was an early
example of reinforced concrete, for it was made
of concrete in which bronze bars were laid. The
lead for the water-pipes was probably brought
from Cornwall.</p>

<p>The Therm&aelig; of Diocletian could accommodate
3,200 bathers. Its tepidarium was 300 ft. long
by nearly 100 ft. wide, "vaulted in three bays with
simple quadripartite groining, which springs from
eight monolithic columns of Egyptian granite
about 50 ft. high and 5 ft. in diameter"
(Middleton).</p>

<p>From the medical point of view, these great
bathing institutions were capable of being used for
the treatment of various diseases, and for physical
culture. No doubt, they were extensively employed
for these purposes and with good results, but
their legitimate use became increasingly limited,
and abuse of them was a prime factor in promoting
national decay. To show to what an extent
luxurious bathing was carried in some instances,
it is interesting to read that baths were taken
sometimes in warm perfumes, in saffron oil, and
that the voluptuous Popp&aelig;a soothed her skin in
baths of milk drawn from a herd of 500 she-asses.</p>

<h3>SANITATION.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">Water-supply &mdash; Its extent &mdash; The Aqueducts &mdash; Distribution in
city &mdash; Drainage &mdash; Disposal of the Dead &mdash; Cremation and
Burial &mdash; Catacombs &mdash; Public Health Regulations.</p></div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Water-supply</span>.</h4>

<p>In ancient Greece, the cities were supplied
with water from springs over which beautiful fountains
were erected. The Greek aqueducts were
not on the same grand scale as the Roman, but
were usually rectangular channels cut in the
rock, or made of pipes or masonry. Great care
was taken in the supervision of these public
works.</p>

<p>The first Roman aqueduct, according to Frontinus,
dates from 312 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Pliny wrote of the Claudian aqueduct: "But if
anyone will carefully calculate the quantity of
the public supply of water, for baths, reservoirs,
houses, trenches, gardens and suburban villas, and,
along the distance which it traverses, the arches
built, the mountains perforated, the valleys levelled,
he will confess that there never was anything more
wonderful in the whole world."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Frontinus, who was controller of the aqueducts
in the time of Nerva and of Trajan, describes nine
aqueducts, of which four belonged to the days of
the Republic, and five to the reigns of Augustus
and Claudius.</p>

<p>"The total water-supply of Rome has been
estimated at 332,306,624 gallons a day, or, taking
the population at a million, 332 gallons a head.
Forty gallons a day is now considered sufficient."<a name="FNanchor_XIII_1" id="FNanchor_XIII_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_XIII_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The ancient Aqua Virgo at the present day
supplies the magnificent Fontana di Trevi, and
the glorious fountains in the Piazzo di Spagna
and the Piazzo Navona.</p>

<p>The Romans not only provided great aqueducts
for the Imperial City, but also built them throughout
various parts of the Empire. In Rome, the
aqueducts were built to supply both the low
and the high levels of the city. The reason why
the Romans did not build underground aqueducts,
as is done at the present day, has been variously
explained. Perhaps they did not fully understand
that water will find its own level over a
great distance. They also would have found great
difficulty in overcoming the high pressure of the
water.</p>

<p>In their conduits they built shafts at frequent
intervals designed to relieve the pressure of compressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
air in the pipes. The water from the
neighbourhood of Rome rapidly encrusted channels
and pipes with calcareous deposits. Probably the
great advantage of accessibility to leaks and defects
gained by building unenclosed aqueducts appealed
strongly to the ancient Romans. They did not
fully understand the technical difficulties involved
in the "hydraulic mean gradient." No machinery
was used to pump the water or raise it to an
artificial level. A strip of land 15 ft. wide was
left on either side of the aqueducts, and this land
was defined at intervals by boundary stones. No
trees were grown near the aqueduct, to avoid the
risk of injuring the foundations, and any breach
of the rules for the preservation of the aqueducts
was severely punished by fines.</p>

<p>Vitruvius gives rules for testing the water, and
points out that water led through earthen pipes is
more wholesome than water coming from leaden
ones. He states that the "fall" of an aqueduct
should be not less than 1 in 200. A circuit was
often made to prevent the too rapid flow of the
water, and intermediate reservoirs were constructed
to avoid a shortage of water in the case of a broken
main. Reservoirs were also used for irrigation.</p>

<p>The water from the aqueduct was received at
the walls of the city in a great reservoir called
<i>castellum aquarum</i>, externally a beautiful building
and internally a vast chamber lined with hard
cement and covered with a vaulted roof supported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
on pillars. The water flowed thence into three
smaller reservoirs, the middle one filled by the overflow
of the two outer ones. The outer reservoirs
supplied the public baths and private houses, while
the middle one supplied the public ponds and
fountains, so that, in the event of a shortage of
water, the first supply to fail was the least
important. The amount of water provided for
private use could be checked, for purposes of
revenue, by means of this arrangement.</p>

<p>At first the aqueducts were not connected with
private houses, but, later, private persons were
allowed to buy the water which escaped from
leaks in the aqueducts. Next, private connections
were made with the public mains, and, finally,
reservoirs were built at the expense of adjoining
households, but these reservoirs, although built
with private money, were considered part of the
public property. Water rights were renewed with
each change of occupant. The water-supply to a
house was measured by the size of the pipe through
which it passed at the in-flow and at the out-flow
of the reservoir.</p>

<p>The <i>curatores aquarum</i> had very responsible
duties. Under their orders, in the time of Trajan,
were 460 slaves who were subdivided into various
classes, each of which had its own particular duties
to perform in connection with the maintenance and
control of the water-supply. A supply of pure
water and proper drainage are of first importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
in sanitation, and it is evident that the Romans
understood these matters well.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Drainage</span>.</h4>

<p>The drains of Athens, built of brick and stone
and provided with air-shafts, ran into a basin
from which pipes carried the sewage beneath the
surrounding plain which it helped to fertilize.</p>

<p>The chief drain of Rome was the Cloaca Maxima,
and there was a great network of smaller drains.
The privy in private houses was usually situated
near the kitchen, and a common drain from the
kitchen and the privy discharged into the public
cloaca. A pipe opened just above the floor of the
closet to supply water for flushing. Ruins of very
small rooms have been discovered in the Via Sacra
of the Roman Forum, and it has puzzled arch&aelig;ologists
to discover their use, but they are thought to
have been sanitary closets. The sewers of Rome
drained into the Tiber.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Disposal of the Dead</span>.</h4>

<p>Both in Greece and Rome earth-burial and
cremation were employed for the disposal of the
dead. Near the Temple of Faustina in the Roman
Forum, under the Via Sacra, have been found the
graves of some of the dwellers of the hills before
Romulus founded the city. In Rome, burial within
the city was forbidden from the time of the Twelve
Tables. Exceptions were made in the case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
emperors, vestal virgins, and famous men, such as
those who had been honoured with triumphs. The
large cemetery for the poor lay on the east side
of the city and the tombs of the rich were along
the roadsides. The remains of some of these can
now be seen along the Appian Way. One of
these tombs is the Tomb of the Scipios, which,
as Byron wrote, "contains no ashes now." Near
the Tomb of the Scipios can be seen a door with
high steps which leads to the <i>columbaria</i>. These
are little rooms provided with pigeon-holes for
the reception of the ashes of the freedmen of
notabilities. Inscriptions show that some of these
freedmen were physicians, and others musicians
and silversmiths. The shops of the perfumers stood
in a part of the Forum on the Via Sacra. Perfumes
were much used at incinerations to disguise
the smell of decomposition before the fires
were kindled. The Christians opposed cremation
and favoured earth burial, and in time the business
of the perfume-sellers failed, and Constantine
bought their shops.</p>

<p>The <i>Catacombs</i> were used almost entirely by the
Christians. If all the passages of the Catacombs
could be placed in line, it is said that they would
extend the whole length of Italy. They were hewn
out of volcanic soil very well suited for the purpose,
and were probably extensions, in the first place, of
quarries made for the purpose of obtaining building
cement. They were used by the Christians, not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
for the religious rite of burial, but also as secluded
meeting places. The bodies were laid in <i>loculi</i>,
sometimes in two or three tiers, the loculi being
filled in with earth and stone.</p>

<p>Many of our public health regulations had their
counterpart in ancient times, for instance, any
factory or workshop in Rome which created a
public nuisance had to be removed outside the
city. The <i>spoliarium</i> of the Coliseum was an
ancient morgue.</p>

<p>A detached building or room, <i>valetudinarium</i>,
was provided in large houses for sick slaves. This
was for the purpose of preventing infection as well
as for convenient attendance on the sick.</p>

<h3>FEES IN ANCIENT TIMES.</h3>

<p>The professional incomes of doctors in ancient
Greece and Rome varied greatly as at the present
day. A few were paid very large fees, but the rank
and file did not make more money than was equal
to keeping them in decency.</p>

<p>Seleucus paid Erasistratus about &pound;20,000 for
curing his son Antiochus. Herodotus mentions
that the &AElig;ginetans (532 <span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>) paid Democedes,
from the public treasury, &pound;304 a year; the
Athenians afterwards paid him &pound;406 a year, and
at Samos he received &pound;422 yearly. Pliny says
that Albutius, Arruntius, Calpetanus, Cassius and
Rubrius each made close upon &pound;2,000 a year, and
that Quintus Stertinius favoured the Emperor by
accepting about &pound;4,000 a year when he could have
made more in private practice. The surgeon Alcon
made a fortune of nearly &pound;100,000 by a few years'
practice in Gaul. Pliny states that Manlius Cornutus
paid his doctor &pound;2,000 for curing him of a
skin disease, and Galen's fee for curing the wife
of a consul was about &pound;400 of our money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
